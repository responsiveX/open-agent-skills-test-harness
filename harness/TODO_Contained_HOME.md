## 0. STATUS — claude is DONE (2026-07-23)

The open decision is settled and the claude adapter is implemented, mutation-tested, and
live-verified. What changed:

- **Decision: MATERIALIZE.** Contained mode is `isolation.build_isolated_home(
  contained_subpaths=...)` — `None` keeps the historical symlink overlay; a sequence
  (including empty) switches the wholesale symlink pass OFF and copies only what is named, so
  `home_write_escapes()` returns `[]` and `_refuse_uncontained_home` lifts **untouched**.
- **claude's surface is `[]` — nothing copied.** On macOS claude authenticates from the login
  **keychain**, not from HOME, so a contained HOME needs `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` exported
  (the operator exports it like any `${VAR}`; the harness does **not** read the keychain).
  Verified live on 2.1.113: an empty contained HOME runs, calls its MCP tool, and still emits
  `claude_code_version` in its init event.
- **The materialize cost/downside for claude is therefore zero** — no credential duplication,
  no per-adapter live-run loop. That will NOT hold for the next adapters (see §1).
- **Both in-overlay pass-through sites also copy under containment** (vendor skills in
  `_build_skills_dir`, plugin packages in `_mask_plugin_registry_dir`) — the easy-to-miss part.
- **A contained subpath colliding with a mask is refused at build time** (`_insert_copy_leaf`):
  copying the real MCP config over the neutral `{}` would be contained but a hermeticity
  regression that looks like it worked.
- Verification: selftest **469 arms** (was 461: +9, −1 decorative), `mutate_mcp.py`
  **79/79** caught by the intended arm, live credential run contained with the token in no
  artifact and no real-home file. `mutate_mcp.py` gained a per-selftest `timeout` so a looping
  mutation can never again wedge the suite.

## 0b. STATUS — all four adapters are now mapped (2026-07-27)

The prediction in the paragraph this replaces was **wrong in the interesting direction**, and
the way it was wrong is the finding. It said the next adapters' auth "may well live under
HOME, so their `contained_home_subpaths` will be non-empty and the credential-duplication
story becomes real for them". Measured, on macOS:

| adapter | credential store | surface | duplication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude 2.1.113 | login keychain | `[]` + `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | none |
| copilot 1.0.72 | login keychain | `[]` + `GH_TOKEN` (or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`) | none |
| antigravity 1.1.7 | login keychain | **unmapped (`None`) — no route exists** | n/a |
| codex 0.140.0 | **file** (`~/.codex/auth.json`) | `[".codex/auth.json"]` | real |

**Three of four keep auth in the macOS login keychain, which a contained home structurally
cannot reach** — reaching it needs `~/Library/Keychains`, and that is an outward symlink,
which containment forbids by its own escape rule. Copying is not the fallback: that file is
every password on the machine. claude's note had already worked this out for claude; what is
new is that it generalizes, and that it makes the env-var token the *normal* answer rather
than a claude peculiarity. Materialize's headline cost — duplicating long-lived credentials —
turns out to apply to exactly **one** adapter.

**The method mattered more than any single answer.** Additive probing (guess a surface, see if
it works) confirmed nothing and produced two wrong guesses for copilot — `.copilot/config.json`
*looks* like the credential store, and the CLI's own error message points at `gh auth login`.
What worked is **subtractive**: start from the overlay, which is known to work, and mask
top-level HOME entries until auth breaks. `harness/tools/probe_contained_home.py --bisect`
does that in ~7 runs and lands on `~/Library`, then `~/Library/Keychains` confirms it. The
tool drives the harness's own launch path (`build_isolated_home` → `adapter.env` →
`adapter.build_argv` → `exec.run_captured`), so what it measures is what a cell would get.

**All of this was measured on macOS, and `contained_home_subpaths` is not platform-conditional
— but the gap that leaves is narrower than it first looks.** The harness runs on macOS *and*
Linux; only Windows is refused, and deliberately (`exec._unsupported_platform`: a Job Object
cannot be assigned until `CreateProcess` returns, so a grandchild started in that window — an
MCP server most of all — escapes it permanently).

The machinery is portable: `isolation.py`'s containment path contains no platform branch at
all. So is the recommended route — `[]` plus an environment token works anywhere, because the
token comes from the environment rather than from HOME, and the keychain never enters into it.
What does not port is the *negative* half of the finding: "the keychain is unreachable, so `[]`
is the only answer." On Linux there is probably a credential file under HOME that would let a
contained run work with no token exported, and nobody has looked; antigravity's `None` may be
wrong in its own favour there for the same reason. These declarations are therefore **correct
but incomplete** on Linux rather than false, and what is missing buys convenience, not safety.
Tracked in §6, along with the ordering constraint that matters more than the mapping itself:
the selftest is not Linux-clean, and a surface validated by a suite that does not pass is not
a measurement.

Three things worth carrying forward:

- **antigravity is a negative result, and it is recorded as one.** It has no env-var
  credential (its 1.1.7 binary contains no `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY` string) and its
  keychain is unreachable, so `contained_home_subpaths` stays `None` and the refusal keeps
  firing — which is the correct outcome, not a gap. Note the failure mode if anyone forces
  it: agy with no readable credential does not exit, it falls back to **interactive OAuth**
  and opens a browser at a Google sign-in page. A headless cell hangs there for 60s. The
  probe now suppresses browser launching by default for exactly this reason; the bisect that
  discovered it opened a sign-in tab on the operator's machine first.
- **codex is the one that pays.** It stores a file, and it reads no credential from the
  environment at all — an invalid `OPENAI_API_KEY` produces a response byte-identical to
  setting nothing, so the variable is never consulted in `exec` mode. The rotation hazard is
  therefore live: the child can rewrite its copy, and a rotated refresh token dies with the
  tempdir while the real store keeps the old one. Measured with `--rotation-check`: codex did
  **not** rewrite the copy, and the real `auth.json` was byte-identical after a full run.
  That is one run, whose token had last refreshed nine days earlier — it is not "codex never
  rotates", and it should be re-checked rather than cited.
- **codex cells could not run at all — found here, fixed here.** codex refuses to start
  outside a git repo or trusted project, every cell workspace is a detached tempdir, and
  nothing passed `--skip-git-repo-check`, so codex runs had been dying before reaching the
  model since at least 2026-07-17. It failed identically under the plain overlay, so
  containment did not cause it; mapping codex's surface is simply what made anyone look.
  The flag is now on both the cell and probe argv, and `cheapshot_harness_smoke` on
  gpt-5.4-mini passes **7/7** — the first codex cell this harness has completed.

  The flag rather than `git init`, deliberately: both clear the gate (verified 0.140.0), but
  codex resolves a *trusted project's* `.codex/config.toml` from the git root above cwd, and
  that file contributes MCP servers — so creating a repo in the workspace would open a config
  channel inside the one directory the agent can write to, after `_mcp_disable_args` has
  already enumerated. What the flag gives up is codex's guardrail against editing files it
  cannot roll back, which this harness does not rely on: the workspace is a throwaway tempdir
  that gets archived, and the sandbox stays `workspace-write` with approvals off.

  Worth noting how it hid for ten days: **a cell that never starts is indistinguishable from
  a cell that failed.** The result was a red cell with an error string, which is what a bad
  model answer also looks like. Arm `codex.skips_the_git_repo_trust_gate` exists so it cannot
  hide again, on the probe path too — there the same defect is disguised as an *unavailable
  model*, which is worse.

Verification: selftest **477 arms** (474 on `main`, +3), `mutate_mcp.py` **88/88** caught by the intended arm
(M86 codex-surface-collides-with-its-skills-dir, M87 copilot-env-strips-a-declared-credential-var,
M88/M89 codex-loses-the-trust-gate-flag on the cell and probe argv), plus two live runs:
`cheapshot_harness_smoke` on copilot with `GH_TOKEN` set, which ran **contained** rather than
refused and left **zero** occurrences of the token across the artifact tree; and the same
scenario on codex/gpt-5.4-mini, which passes **7/7**.

The rest of this doc is the original handoff. §1's cost table is still the right analysis; it
simply resolves to "free" for three adapters and "real" for one.

---

## 1. The job

**Credential-bearing MCP runs are refused. Make them possible without lying about it.**

A scenario whose `mcp_servers:` interpolates a `${VAR}` is currently refused before the agent
launches. That is correct today and it blocks the headline feature of Phase 1.

Why it is refused: the isolated HOME is a symlink **mask**, not a sandbox. `_overlay()` passes
every unmasked real-HOME entry through as a symlink, so `$HOME/.cache/x` *is* `~/.cache/x`,
and writing to a passed-through file overwrites the real one. Once an MCP tool result can
hand the resolved token back to the model, the model can write it where this harness neither
deletes nor scrubs. Deleting the overlay afterwards proves nothing about where its symlinks
pointed, and there is no scrub available: the harness does not know which of the real home's
directories were written to and will not go searching a user's home.

So the refusal is not conservatism to be relaxed. **Lifting it requires actually containing
the writes.**

### The open decision (SETTLED 2026-07-23 → materialize; see §0. Kept for the reasoning.)

| | Materialize | Allowlist + verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What | Build only the adapter's declared config surface. Real directories, files **copied**, no outward symlinks at all. | Keep declared auth files as symlinks; hash them before and after the run; fail the cell if content changed. |
| Guarantee | Prevention | Detection after the fact |
| Cost | Per-adapter empirical work: nobody knows what each CLI actually needs from HOME. Needs live runs. | Small; lands soon. |
| Downside | Duplicates the user's long-lived CLI credentials into a per-cell tempdir. | The token is already in the real file by the time you notice. |

Prior lean (mine, not decided): **materialize**, because this whole line of work has been
"answer about the world, not about the call", and detection-after-the-fact is the weaker
sibling of that. The credential-duplication concern is real but it is precisely what the
`_purge`/`_remove` machinery exists to clean up, at `0700`, verifiably.

Note the forcing constraint: **our own escape rule is "any symlink resolving outside the
overlay."** A contained HOME therefore contains *no* outward symlinks — including auth. Under
materialize, auth files must be copied, not linked. That is not an incidental detail; it is
the crux of the cost.

Failure mode of materialize is a CLI erroring because something it needed was not declared —
fails closed, which is right, but it is a slow live-run loop per adapter.

---

## 2. What already exists (do not rebuild)

| Thing | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `home_write_escapes(home)` | `agentskill_evals/isolation.py` | Every symlink in the overlay whose `realpath` falls outside it. **This is the lifting condition** — when it returns `[]`, the refusal stops firing on its own. Do not add special cases to it; make the HOME satisfy it. |
| `_refuse_uncontained_home(home, eval_name, refs)` | `agentskill_evals/runner.py` | The refusal. Also refuses when `home is None` (no overlay = real HOME). |
| `interpolated_refs(servers)` | `agentskill_evals/mcp.py` | Which declared fields carry a `${VAR}`. The exposure gate. **Never** use `bool(secrets)` for this — short values are excluded from redaction on purpose and are still credentials. |
| `build_isolated_home(...)` / `_overlay(...)` | `agentskill_evals/isolation.py` | The overlay builder you will be changing. `_overlay` step 1 is the wholesale symlink pass — the thing that creates every escape. |
| `_CellCleanup` / `_purge` / `_remove` | `agentskill_evals/runner.py` | Registration + verified outward-in removal of credential directories, with findings that survive a crash. If you copy credentials anywhere, register the directory here. |
| `probe_contained_home.py` | `harness/tools/` | Maps an adapter's contained surface against the real CLI, driving the harness's own launch path. `--bisect` is the subtractive search that finds where a CLI's credential lives; `--rotation-check` reports whether the child rewrote a copied credential; `--overlay` is the control that separates "containment broke it" from "already broken". Suppresses browser launching by default — a CLI that cannot authenticate may fall back to interactive OAuth. |
| `_scrub_tree` and friends | `agentskill_evals/runner.py` | Archived-workspace scrub. Not in scope, but read `_scrub_file`/`_scrub_link` before writing any new filesystem traversal — they encode the object-kind inventory the hard way. |

Adapter contract fields that declare HOME surface (`adapters/base.py`):
`global_skills_subpaths`, `isolation_config_masks`, `plugin_registry_config_masks`,
`global_plugin_registry_subpaths`, `isolation_config_homes`.
Materialize will likely need a new one — "these subpaths must be materialized writable" — and
that is an adapter-contract change, so it needs a default that fails closed.

---

## 3. Constraints that must not regress

These are settled. They cost ten review rounds; do not relitigate them in code.

1. **A fact learned by executing a program the agent independently executes again may not
   CLEAR a security decision.** Version telemetry may *warn*; only the runtime contract may
   *pass* a run.
2. **The executing version is read from the run's own structural telemetry** — never a probe,
   never model-controlled text (assistant prose), never workspace-controlled text
   (`source: "project"` skill paths).
3. **Adapters fail closed rather than degrade silently.**
4. **Secrets:** `${VAR}` from the harness process env only; fail-fast at validation; never
   committed in YAML; scratch config `0600`, outside the workspace, deleted post-run; every
   interpolated secret scrubbed from all artifacts including recorded `argv`.
5. **The exec workspace is unconditionally detached** and moved into `artifacts/` afterwards.
   Not tied to the isolation flag — a cwd is a write capability.
6. **Deletion is answered by `os.path.lexists`, not by "did this raise."**
7. **A finding is forgotten only once it is on disk**, and acknowledged at the return, because
   `_failed_cell` *rewrites* `result.json` from a rebuilt result.

### 3a. The credential-handling invariant (cost four review rounds; do not rediscover)

**Credential presence, redaction values, containment, refusal, and cleanup severity must all
derive from the same effective environment supplied to the child, after scenario overrides.**

That environment is one expression: `child_env = {**os.environ, **(spec.env or {})}` — the merge
`exec.execute` itself builds (`base = dict(os.environ); base.update(spec.env)`). Every credential
decision in `_run_cell_body` reads from it. The four P1 findings this branch closed were each a
different decision reading from a *narrower* source:

- **Presence** (`has_credentials`) scans the adapter's `credential_env_vars` against `child_env`.
  Sampling `os.environ` missed a token supplied only via `spec.env` (P1d): the child got it, the
  harness didn't — so no containment, no refusal, no redaction, yet the token was delivered.
- **Redaction values** are read `child_env[name]`, not `os.environ[name]`. A `spec.env` override
  reaches the child, so redacting the ambient value scrubs the wrong string and leaks the real
  one (P1a registered the env token at all; P1d fixed which value gets registered).
- **Containment** (materialize a contained HOME) and **refusal** (`_refuse_uncontained_home`,
  including under `isolated: false`) key off that same presence signal — an env credential
  triggers them exactly as an interpolated `${VAR}` does, not only when `mcp_servers:`
  interpolates (P1c).
- **Cleanup severity** (`_CONTAINED_TAIL` + `fatal=` on the HOME registration, vs `_EXPOSED_TAIL`)
  treats a HOME that *copies* long-lived auth as credential-bearing from the moment it is
  registered, before the copy lands (P1b).

Every hole had the same shape: a credential decision reading something narrower than the child's
effective env (the process env alone, or an interpolated field alone). Don't reintroduce one.

**`credential_env_vars` is a survival assertion.** Naming a variable there asserts that the
adapter's `env()` forwards it into the child *unchanged* — it survives the transformation. The
runner samples `child_env` **before** `adapter.env()` runs and trusts the value arrives, which
holds only because `base.env()` mutates HOME/USERPROFILE/XDG/config-home vars and copies
everything else through verbatim: it can neither add nor drop a credential name. A future adapter
whose `env()` rewrote or stripped a declared credential var would break this — the harness would
redact and contain on a value the child never received — so do not declare a variable the adapter
transforms without also teaching detection about the transform.

**...and it is not a statement about how the CLI authenticates.** It says these names are
forwarded and must be redacted. It does not say they are the *only* way in, so it cannot be read
as one: a CLI may authenticate through a credential helper, a socket, or a workload identity that
a contained HOME leaves perfectly intact. `_refuse_uncredentialed_contained_home` — the preflight
that refuses a contained cell with no credential route rather than spending a model call to
rediscover "Not logged in" — therefore reads a **separate** adapter declaration,
`contained_home_required_credential_env_vars`, whose whole content is that measured claim. Its
default `None` means "unanswered" and fires nothing; `[]` is the positive "no env credential
needed here"; a non-empty list is what the refusal acts on, and every name in it must also appear
in `credential_env_vars`. Deriving the requirement from `credential_env_vars` plus an empty
`contained_home_subpaths` was the first implementation and was wrong in the direction that costs a
user a working run (review, PR #99) — mutation M117 is that exact inference, kept so it cannot
come back.

Locked by arms `credential_detection_reads_the_childs_effective_environment`,
`credential_env_var_triggers_containment_without_mcp_servers`,
`credential_env_var_run_is_refused_under_isolated_false`, `adapter_credential_env_var_is_redacted`,
and `contained_home_that_copies_auth_is_credential_bearing_before_the_copy` (mutations M81–M85),
plus `mcp.contained_home_without_its_credential_env_var_is_refused` and
`contained.required_credential_env_vars_are_declared_and_answered` (M115–M119).

## 4. Verification protocol

Non-negotiable, in this order. `SELFTEST PASSED` alone is not evidence.

Run from the REPO ROOT. `make -C`, not `cd harness &&` — a `cd` persists for the rest of the
block, so the line after it looked for `harness/harness/.venv/bin/python` and the block could
not be pasted as written (review, fifth round).

```sh
make -C harness dev             # once — creates .venv with the PINNED ruff AND shellcheck

harness/.venv/bin/python -m agentskill_evals.cli selftest     # prints "— N arms"; 581 here
harness/.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q harness/agentskill_evals/
make -C harness lint                                          # ruff + shellcheck + a parse under every shell
python3 -u harness/tools/mutate_mcp.py --jobs 8               # 354/354 production + 3/3 instrument + 257/257 fixture

harness/.venv/bin/python harness/tools/verify_restricted_env.py # restricted_env.sh's FAILURE paths; 139 here, over the 5 shells on this machine
git diff --check

# AFTER the mutation run, because what it should have left behind is nothing, and "the
# suite was green" is a different fact from "the machine is as it was". A run that could
# not establish containment KEEPS its work trees on purpose and says so — the first line
# is what then reports them. The `[.]` is not a typo: `pgrep -f` matches this command's
# own argv, so a plain pattern finds itself and reports a guardian that is the search.
ls -d "${TMPDIR%/}"/mutate-mcp-*                # no work trees
pgrep -f 'mcp_proxy_io[.]py --guardian'         # no stray guardians
ps -eo stat= | grep -c '^[Tt]'                  # 0 — nothing left SIGSTOPped by a sweep

# OPT-IN, not part of the block above: needs `claude` on PATH and spends an API call.
# Run it when the CLI updates — §9's probe-#1 result is version-qualified, and this is
# what remeasures it rather than trusting a paragraph. Its own startup path and the
# mutation runner's suite-readers are driven OFFLINE by the fixture verifier (§E17, §E18),
# because "nothing routine runs it" is exactly how a fix lands in one copy and not the other.
harness/.venv/bin/python harness/tools/probe_remote_mcp.py    # 19 checks; claude 2.1.113 (http asserts 2 more than sse)

# ALSO OPT-IN, and cheaper: no CLI, no API call, no credential against the default target.
# Reaches a live remote MCP server, so it is out of the block for that reason alone. Q4 holds
# sessions idle for W and therefore takes W (default 600s, the harness's own cell cap) — pass
# --skip-survival for the rest in about 20s. Its classifiers are driven offline at §E20.

```

### Running the block where the OS says no

**The block used to be unrunnable under a restricted environment, and the way it failed was
worse than failing.** `verify_mcp_fixtures.py` is a linear script: an unhandled raise ends it
where it stands. A reviewer running it in a sandbox that denies process enumeration got **376
of 559 checks, the last of them green, a traceback, and no line anywhere saying that E18, E19
and E20 never executed** (external review, PR #115). Absence of a result, read as a result, in
the file whose whole job is refusing that reading.

**Three capabilities are involved, and only one of them ever stopped the run:**

| Capability | Used by | What it did |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ps -eo …` (process enumeration) | `mutate_mcp.process_tree`, via every LIVE containment arm in §E17 | **Aborted the script.** `kill_owned` raises `ObserverFailed` rather than reporting a clean tree — deliberately, and a check exists to keep it that way — so the verifier is what had to stop treating a denied capability as a crash. |
| `bind()` on loopback | the `http_mcp_server.py` fixtures in §E16 | Two red checks, then ~36 arms silently not run, because the body is already behind `if _rm.up:`. |
| `socket(AF_UNIX)` + `bind()` | one selftest fixture | One red arm out of 579. **Now uses `os.mkfifo`**, which needs no socket privileges. |

**What replaced them is a third result state.** Each capability is probed once, and a section
that cannot run is recorded by `skip()` rather than crashed on or quietly passed over. A
skipped section is **not a pass**: `skipped` joins `fails` in the exit status, the reasons are
printed under an `INCOMPLETE` heading, and the summary line refuses the word. The
discrimination is what makes it honest — loopback *denied* is a skip; loopback available and a
fixture that still will not start is a defect, and stays red.

**Reproduce a restricted environment here rather than trusting that it works there.**
`harness/tools/restricted_env.sh` denies each capability and runs the suites under each denial
and under both. Each denial is one line; the `bind()` one reaches child processes through
`PYTHONPATH`, which is the only reason it touches the fixtures at all — they are subprocesses.

```sh
harness/tools/restricted_env.sh                                  # the reproduction itself
harness/.venv/bin/python harness/tools/verify_restricted_env.py  # and its FAILURE paths
```

**It was sixty lines of shell in a fenced block in this file, and that is why it took six review
rounds.** Five of the six findings were fail-OPEN — a construction step whose failure let a later
step run unrestricted, a leak on a second allocation, a signal handler that cleaned up and
*returned*, a signal set that was "the ones I tested", a status collision — and every one of them
reported green while broken. Prose-shell is the one artifact here that the suite cannot run, so
it converged at the speed of review attention rather than the speed of the harness. Moving it
bought three things a fenced block cannot have:

- **`shellcheck` in `make lint`**, pinned like Ruff and installed by `make dev`. It found a real
  defect the moment it was aimed at the script — not a style nit: the payload hook invoked a bare
  `sh`, which under the `ps`-denied phase is not on PATH at all, so it died 127 without running.
  That is the script's own "absolute interpreter" lesson, re-introduced two lines away from the
  comment explaining it.
- **Every rationale beside the line it defends**, where it is read by whoever edits that line
  rather than by whoever happens to read this file.
- **The failure paths below as CHECKS** rather than as controls run by hand in a scratch
  directory that dies with the session. That is the whole argument: the lessons in this section
  were each paid for once, and until now nothing re-derived them on every run.

**And the script's own exit status was the next instance of the same class.** It discarded every
phase status and always exited 0, on the stated theory that the suites' reports were the output
and folding "sections were skipped" into a failure would hide the interesting case. Driving all
four phases to exit 7 still returned 0 (external review). A denial that silently does not take
then produces UNRESTRICTED green verifier runs with a green reproduction on top of them — the one
outcome the script exists to make impossible. Each phase now declares the status **and the
evidence** it must produce, and **section D** drives that production path against a stub
interpreter: the reported exit-7 case, a run where the denial did not take, and a half-applied
denial whose status is correct and whose bind() skip reason never appears. Only the evidence
catches the last one, which is why a status alone was never going to be enough — and why the
evidence is the skip REASONS rather than the skip counts, which drift when a section is added.

**Then the way those cases were WRITTEN turned out to prove less than it looked.** Each broke
several expectations at once and asserted only "non-zero status, and some PROBLEM", so no case
showed that any individual guard discriminates — deleting a requirement outright left every case
green, because the remaining problems still rejected the run (external review). Each case now
breaks exactly one requirement in one phase and demands the exact `PROBLEM` line, plus the
absence of any other. The deeper version of the same trap survived even that: section D
GENERATES its cases from the script's own `judge` calls, so deleting a requirement deletes the
case that would have caught it — a universal quantified over a set the subject controls. The
fix is §4's own rule, a structural clause ahead of the universal: the contract is stated
independently in the verifier, phase by phase, so removing a demand reddens a check rather than
shrinking the matrix. **Section E then breaks the script one thing at a time on every run**, and
requires the section NAMED for each break to redden on the CHECK named for it — an aggregate
non-zero status does not say which guard noticed, or whether any did for the right reason. The
declaration mutations are GENERATED from the contract, one requirement per phase plus each
status and each whole judge call, so a hand-written list cannot quietly sample a subset while
the prose claims "each" (external review). The second kind matters more: breaking `judge`
itself — its status comparison, its evidence loop, its counter, its final verdict — leaves every
declaration intact, so only section D can catch it, and until those existed **nothing had ever
shown section D to be load-bearing at all**. Two controls run first, because "the child went
red" is evidence about the mutation only if the child can go green, and only if the flag it runs
under is honoured: accepting a mistyped `--only` ran two sections and exited 0, making a typo
look like a pass.

**THE FAILURE PATHS ARE TESTED, NOT JUST THE HAPPY ONE**, and that is the lesson this script
cost three review rounds to learn. Each round fixed the step the finding named — `mktemp`, then
its guard, then the writes after it — while the siblings stayed open, because the verification
was aimed at the finding rather than at the class. The class is: **any step whose failure lets a
later step run in a state it claims not to be in.** A missing `sitecustomize.py` does not error;
it makes the "bind denied" run silently UNRESTRICTED, which publishes a false negative rather
than a failure — strictly worse than crashing.

**Section A** of `verify_restricted_env.py` drives the script with each construction step failing
in turn — `mktemp`, `mkdir`, `chmod`, `cat`, and an unwritable sandbox, which no PATH stub can
produce — asserting three things every time: **the phases are never reached, the exit status is
non-zero, and no sandbox is left behind.** It carries a POSITIVE control beside them, because
"no phase was reached" is also what a script that never ran at all produces: unbroken, every
phase must run, and the expected number is read out of the script rather than written down.

**INTERRUPTION IS A FAILURE PATH TOO, and the first trap here got it exactly backwards.**
`trap 'rm -rf "$sandbox"' EXIT INT TERM` cleans up and *returns*, so the shell carries on: the
sandbox is gone, `PATH="$sandbox/nops"` names nothing, and every remaining run executes with no
denial in place and reports green. Signalling the process group — what Ctrl-C actually does —
during the first verifier run showed it plainly: **exit 0 and three further runs completed**,
each of them unrestricted and each of them reported as a pass. The handlers now `exit`, and the
same control gives one phase, exit 130 (SIGINT) or death by signal (SIGTERM), and no leak. That a
CLEANUP fix introduced a fail-open path is the same lesson one turn later: the class is any step
whose failure lets a later step run in a state it claims not to be in, and a signal handler that
returns is such a step. The always-fail stub used in the previous round could only ever
exercise the FIRST allocation — the hole it missed and the test that missed it had the same
shape, which is why the fixture checks below are on the ARTIFACTS rather than on the commands
that wrote them.

**AND `INT`/`TERM` WERE THE TWO SIGNALS THAT HAD BEEN TESTED, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME SET AS THE
ONES THAT ARRIVE.** Ctrl-\ sends `QUIT`; untrapped, it killed the shell with the EXIT trap unrun
and the sandbox left behind (external review). Handling the named signal alone would have been
the reproduction rather than the principle. A second control with an EXIT trap that leaves a
witness line says *why* the other three held under bash, which the leak matrix alone cannot:
**bash runs the EXIT trap on `HUP`, `PIPE` and `TERM` itself, and skips it on `QUIT`.** "The
sandbox went away" is not "my handler removed it," and only the witness separates them.

**Then five handlers were called "every catchable terminating signal," and they are not** —
`ABRT`, `ALRM`, `USR1`, `USR2`, `XCPU` and `XFSZ` also terminate by default and were also unrun
(external review). Two rounds in a row the fix stopped at the reproduction, so the third stops
at a *distinction* instead, with the whole surface measured across every shell on this machine:

**Signals SENT to the script are trapped. Signals raised because the shell itself FAULTED are
not.** **Section C** pins that distinction in BOTH directions — every sent signal trapped with a
handler that `exit`s, no fault signal trapped — by reading the trap table out of the script, so a
handler deleted upstream reddens a check instead of silently shrinking the covered set. A `XCPU` from a CI `ulimit`, an `ALRM` from a timeout wrapper, a human with the wrong pid
— those arrive at a healthy shell that can be trusted to run `rm -rf "$sandbox"`. `ILL`, `TRAP`,
`EMT`, `FPE`, `BUS`, `SEGV` and `SYS` mean the shell process is broken, and a destructive command
issued from a faulted interpreter is a worse bargain than a leaked 0700 directory containing a
fake `ps`. **That is the residual leak surface: those seven at worst — dash and zsh leak all
seven, ksh only `SEGV`, bash and `sh` none — plus `KILL`**, which nobody can trap. Not "every
exit path", and not "every catchable terminating signal" either — this, measured, per shell.

The measurement also killed the argument for leaving any of it to the shell. **EXIT-trap-runs-
anyway is not a property of `sh`:** dash runs it for NONE of the twenty signals — not `INT`, not
`TERM`, not `HUP` — zsh for two, bash for eighteen, ksh for nineteen. The shebang says `sh`
and macOS hands an interactive user zsh, so the two shells most likely to meet this script are
the two that clean up least; section B therefore runs it under EVERY shell present rather than
under the one it was written in. One typographic hazard, since the signal that started this
round is spelled with a backslash: **no comment in the script may END in one.** POSIX discards a comment to the newline and bash-3.2 was checked doing so, but a shell
that continued the line instead would swallow the `trap` beneath it — silently, and in the
direction that removes a handler.

**The control that measured this was itself vacuous on the first run, and said PASS.** It pointed
`TMPDIR` at a directory of its own and then counted what was left there — but macOS `mktemp -d`
IGNORES `TMPDIR` and allocates in the per-user Darwin temp dir, so the leak check listed a
directory the sandbox was never created in and reported every shape, old and new, as clean.
Nothing was recorded, and nothing-recorded read as nothing-wrong. The fix is the rule from §4
applied to the instrument, and it is now structural: the verifier INTERCEPTS `mktemp` so the
sandbox is allocated where it can see it, rather than guessing where the platform put it. Two
negative controls run FIRST and gate everything after them — a planted sandbox must be detected,
and the script's pre-review trap shape (DERIVED from the shipping file, not typed out beside it)
must be caught leaking under `SIGQUIT`. If either fails the run refuses to continue, because "no
leaks were found" and "no leaks could have been found" print the same way.

Every signal delivered to the process GROUP mid-run — which is what a keyboard signal does, and
what signalling the `sh` pid alone does not reproduce. **How many of the twenty catchable
terminating signals leave the sandbox behind**, with only an EXIT trap installed, and with the
handlers above:

| shell | EXIT trap alone | with the handlers | still leaking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/bin/dash` | **20 of 20 leak** | 7 | the fault signals |
| `/bin/zsh` (macOS interactive default) | 18 of 20 leak | 7 | the fault signals |
| `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash` | 2 of 20 leak (`QUIT`, `PROF`) | **0** | — |
| `/bin/ksh` | 1 of 20 leak (`SEGV`) | 1 | `SEGV` |

**No signal that is SENT to the recipe leaks under any shell measured**; every survivor is a
fault signal, which is the line drawn on purpose. And no shape lets a run start after the
signal — `runs completed = 1` in every trial, the property the previous round's fix bought and
this round must not spend.

Measured here, and each number is a different question answered:

| Run | checks | skips | fails | exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| verifier, `ps` denied | 551 | 5 (E17 live arms) | 0 | 1 |
| verifier, `bind()` denied | 527 | 2 (E16 http + sse) | 0 | 1 |
| verifier, both denied | 519 | 7 | 0 | 1 |
| selftest, `bind()` denied | 581 arms | — | 0 | 0 |

Every restricted **verifier** run reaches **E20 with no traceback and no false failures** — the selftest is in the table for the FIFO arm and has no E20 to reach. The counts in the
block above are the UNRESTRICTED ones — a restricted run reports fewer checks and says which
ones it could not ask, which is the whole point.

**The FIFO carries a hazard the socket did not, and it is bounded rather than avoided.** `M37`
makes the scrub treat every non-directory as a regular file, so it `open()`s the FIFO and never
returns. The relocation arm therefore runs its cell on a **bounded thread** and asserts
`not t15.is_alive()`, exactly as `mcp.special_files_are_removed_rather_than_read` already did —
removing the join re-arms the trap, so `I3` exists to catch that. Verified by hand-applying M37:
the suite finishes in 47s and reports two failing arms rather than wedging.

**`--jobs 8` is the recommended way to run it and `--jobs 1` is what it means.** The suite is
mostly WAITING — the proxy arms are ~43s of settles and grace periods on ~5s of CPU, which is
why a serial run leaves the machine ~90% idle — so N mutations at once is close to an N-fold
saving in wall clock. Nothing that decides a verdict moved: the anchor guards, the arm guards
and the class check still run serially before any tree is mutated, each worker mutates only its
own copy of the tree, the baselines are measured one at a time on an unloaded machine because
they are the REFERENCE every per-mutation number is read against, and results print in list
order however they finish. Pick N from the performance cores, not the core count.

Two things changed underneath so that this is true rather than merely fast, and both are the
same shape — a rule that was right while there was one of something:

- **The proxy verifier's survivor check is scoped by TREE, not by pid identity alone.** Pid
  scoping excludes a guardian leaked by a PREVIOUS mutation, which is a hazard from the past;
  a concurrent worker's guardian is a hazard from the SIDE, genuinely absent before the case
  and genuinely present during it. `mcp_proxy_io.is_guardian_command` now matches the argv
  `guardian_argv` builds, from this copy of the module. Measured during a `--jobs 8` run: 70%
  of `ps` samples had a live guardian in more than one work tree, and 25% had one in all eight.
  It was NOT possible to make the old predicate produce a red check — ~50 concurrent proxy
  suites, including three with the deliberate 30s leak (`M337`), all passed — because
  `_guardians_before` is sampled immediately before the case rather than at startup, leaving
  only a ~1s window for a foreign guardian to be born in. So the fix is a narrowing that is
  correct and cheap rather than one with a reproduction behind it; say so rather than implying
  the run was broken.
- **Per-mutation CPU is read from the `wait4` that reaps THAT child**, not from a
  `getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN)` delta. The delta is a running total for the whole process, so
  under `--jobs N` it collects whatever the other N−1 workers finished inside the same window.
  It is exactly right at `--jobs 1`, which is the only configuration anyone would have driven
  it at — a measurement whose error is invisible in its own test conditions. The two clocks are
  reported separately because they answer different questions: wall is what `_SUITE_TIMEOUT`
  bounds, CPU is what survives a loaded machine, and the M65 early warning below needs the CPU
  one now that wall time under load is a statement about the scheduler.

**The mutation suite now runs THREE suites, and which one runs is a different question from
which total a mutation counts in.** The suite is chosen by the file: `agentskill_evals/` is
proven by the selftest, `fixtures/` and `tools/` by `verify_mcp_fixtures.py`, and the proxy's
I/O half plus its awkward server by `verify_mcp_proxy.py` — the two files named explicitly,
because both sit in a directory another suite owns. The **class** is chosen by the file's role:
`M*` perturbs production, `I*` the selftest itself, `F*` an instrument. Those agreed while
there were two suites and stopped agreeing the moment `mcp_proxy_io.py` arrived — production
code no arm can reach. Running `mutate_mcp.py` therefore covers the last two lines above as
well, and its three totals are three different claims. Do not add them together.

**Every command in that block runs without a network and without a privilege**, and that is a
requirement rather than an observation: the proxy verifier's `read_failed` case used to open a
loopback socket, so under a sandbox that denies `bind()` the whole file died at `EPERM` and a
reviewer could not run the suite this work's evidence rests on (review, PR #103). If a case
needs an arrangement the environment might refuse, find another arrangement — a skipped check
and a check that cannot fail look identical from the outside.

**The arm count is now self-reported** — the selftest ends with `SELFTEST PASSED — N arms`.
It used to live here as a hand-maintained literal and was stale for two PRs running, because
nothing makes forgetting it fail; the number above is what one macOS run produced, kept only
so a reader has something to compare against. Both counts are a FLOOR that only ever goes up:
a lower one means arms or mutations were LOST, which is the single outcome neither command
reports as a failure — and a whole section that silently stopped running now shows as a drop
even though every remaining arm passes. A few arms are conditional (PyYAML, platform), so two
machines legitimately differ by a couple; only the trend on ONE machine is evidence.

**Lint runs from `harness/.venv`, never an ambient ruff.** `pyproject.toml` pins
`required-version = "==0.16.0"` against the `dev` extra that installs it, because a family
selector like `UP` gains rules between releases — unpinned, a tool upgrade arrives looking
exactly like a code regression. A mismatched build refuses to run and names both versions.
The selected families are the ones this tree passes at **zero**, with no `ignore` list, so
any finding is introduced by the change in front of you; what is deliberately not selected is
listed in `pyproject.toml` with the reason. Ruff's `F` family subsumes pyflakes, which is why
the separate pyflakes invocation (and the "pre-existing noise, leave alone" note that used to
sit here) is gone — that noise was fixed rather than documented.

**What `VersionProvenance` does and does not buy.** It is an **audit trail plus a drift
warning**, not verification, and anything written as though it re-checks a claim per build is
overstating it (caught in review of #93). A build outside `_VERIFIED_VERSIONS` *warns and still
runs*. claude's own `witness_held` text says the runtime witness cannot distinguish "the flag
worked" from "a newer build grew a server source outside the flag's reach". codex has less
again: `_VERSION_UNREADABLE` records that it cannot identify the build it just executed at all,
because `--ephemeral` suppresses the only file that carries the version — so its sole check is
an out-of-band `codex --version`. Reviewed assertions that rest on a CLI mechanism
(`mcp_off_mechanism = CLI`, the `--strict-mcp-config` argument, codex's argv disables) are
exactly that: **reviewed**. Nothing here would catch a wrong one. What the machinery buys is
that an unaudited build is *visible* and that re-establishing a claim has a documented
procedure (`clear_hint`).

**Every new arm must be mutation-tested.** Add the mutation to `harness/tools/mutate_mcp.py`
in the same commit as the arm. An arm nothing can break is decorative, and this project has
caught its own decorative arms four separate times.

Mutations carry one of two ID prefixes and are **counted separately** in the summary. `M<n>`
is the normal case: it perturbs production code, and it is what a coverage claim rests on.
`I<n>` perturbs `selftest.py` itself, which is usually circular and proves nothing — it is
legitimate only where the selftest has a feature of its own that no production edit can
reach. Both current entries are the arm counter: `I1` stops it counting, `I2` reverts it to a
process-lifetime total, and each leaves every arm passing while the banner reports a
plausible wrong number. The classification is enforced, not conventional — `mutate_mcp.py`
refuses to start if an `I*` targets anything but the selftest, or an `M*` targets it, because
either mistake miscounts exactly what the split reporting exists to keep straight.

Things that have gone wrong in the *tests*, so you can skip learning them again:

- **The recurring one — a check aimed BESIDE the thing that matters — and the list below is
  what keeps growing, so read its length rather than a numeral here.** Every instance looks
  like coverage and is not, and the shape is always the same — the arm and its
  mutation agree with each other while both sit one level away from where the defect lives.
  Seen as: an arm whose two cases could not see the condition they guarded (M117); a live
  assertion the model could satisfy from its prompt without the mechanism running at all
  (`regress_mcp_two_servers`, twice, and §9 probe #1 — see the marker entry below); two cells
  sharing an artifacts directory so the second
  overwrote what the first was meant to prove (M125); an arm exercising the delta HELPER
  while the regression was the banner's ASSIGNMENT of it (I2); an arm calling the proxy's
  refusal FORMATTER, which is green whether or not any call is ever refused (M158); and — the
  purest form of it — an arm that built `inputRequests` as an array because the code read it
  as one, so the fixture and the defect were wrong together and agreed (M150). Each passed
  review of the code and was caught only by someone asking the question below.

  **The test:** write out what a broken implementation would produce, and check your assertion
  rejects it. If the answer is "it produces exactly what I asserted", the assertion is
  measuring something else. Three corollaries this project keeps rediscovering — a defect that
  passes THROUGH a helper is not tested by testing the helper, only by testing the site it
  reached; for anything with a model in the loop, the model is part of the implementation, so
  an expected value it could reconstruct from its prompt is not evidence; and where the
  subject is a *specification*, the fixture must come from the spec rather than from the code,
  because a fixture written to match the implementation cannot disagree with it. The
  `inputRequests` case and the `{}` subscription closure were both that: hand-written fixtures
  that encoded the same misreading as the code, where one look at the spec's own printed
  example would have shown a map and a `resultType`.
- **A rule applied at the wrong SCOPE is its own defect family, and it cuts both ways.** Three
  findings in one review round were all this shape: a per-version rule applied to every version
  (`inputRequests` read on legacy responses, where `Result` is open-ended and the key means
  whatever that server means by it); a backward-compatibility rule applied to a method that has
  no *back* (an absent `resultType` defaulted to `complete` on `subscriptions/listen`, which
  exists only in the revision where the field is mandatory); and prose followed over the
  schema that is declared the source of truth (`RequestId` refused for `1.5`, which the prose
  calls an integer and the schema calls a number).

  Two of those refuse conforming traffic and one forwards non-conforming traffic, which is the
  point — **over-strict is not the safe direction.** A proxy that fails a clean cell has broken
  the run just as surely as one that forwards a definition, and it is harder to diagnose
  because everything looks like it is working correctly. When writing a check, name the
  version, the direction and the document it comes from; if the rule cannot be stated with
  those three, it is not yet a rule.
- **"Nothing escapes" is a claim about ORDER, and order is the thing to check.** Letting a
  request through on a *pending* handshake looked safe because the negotiated version would
  govern its response — true only if the negotiation lands first, and nothing makes it. The
  pipelined request's response can arrive before the `initialize` response and be read under
  no version at all. When an argument for safety rests on one message preceding another,
  write down what happens in the other order; on a duplex stream both orders happen.
- **A correct principle stated at too narrow a WIDTH is still a hole, and it will be found one
  route at a time.** The spent-request-id rule took four rounds: cancelled ids remembered but
  cleared on reuse; then held, but lifted once a straggler was seen; then held permanently —
  for cancellation only. Each fix was right about the case in front of it. The tell was there
  the whole time: the argument that justified the third version ("no observed response proves
  another cannot follow, because the server is the side we do not control") **never mentioned
  cancellation**, so it had always applied to ordinary answers and graceful closures too, and
  those stayed open. **When an argument lands, re-read what it actually quantifies over and go
  fix every case it covers** — not the one that prompted it. A reviewer should not have to
  walk you along a rule's own scope.
- **An observation that matches a rule's SHAPE may still not be the behaviour it forbids.**
  C3-3 counted any repeated request id as evidence that the spent-id rule costs the fleet. But
  a repeat while the first request is unanswered is a live duplicate, which JSON-RPC forbids
  and the proxy refuses on entirely separate grounds; only a repeat *after* the response is
  the legal-but-refused behaviour being priced. The probe reported a client the proxy rejects
  anyway as proof that the proxy is too strict. **When measuring the cost of a rule, the
  observation has to exclude cases some other rule already covers** — otherwise the price
  includes traffic that was never going to work.
- **Some measurements cannot be taken from where you are standing, and the answer is to stop
  claiming them.** C3-3 needs to know whether an arrival preceded a response. Three rounds of
  work went into observing that better — log at arrival, then drain continuously — and the
  honest end point is that **no observer inside the server can establish it at all**: bytes
  can sit unread in the kernel pipe while the main thread writes a response, so the ordering
  is a property of scheduling, not of the client. Reducing the error rate from systematic to
  occasional is real progress and still not a measurement. The fix was to make the probe
  *report and not conclude*, and to name the workload that would conclude — one where the
  driver waits for each response, so the ordering is true by construction. **When an
  instrument keeps needing to be made more careful, check whether the quantity is observable
  from that vantage point at all.**
- **A new fact about a run belongs in the CLASSIFIER, not bolted onto the exit code.** When
  the shim gained a "my reader died" signal, I threaded it into the exit status and stopped —
  so a broken row still classified as a clean measurement, the fleet-wide conclusion was
  printed over it, and the tool then exited 1 having already published the wrong sentence.
  That is the same "fleet-wide claim from an incomplete run" defect fixed two rounds earlier,
  walking in through a door the fix did not cover, because the earlier fix taught `unmeasured`
  about two ways of being unanswered and this was a third. **When you add a reason a run might
  be untrustworthy, put it where the existing reasons live** — one predicate that everything
  downstream reads — rather than beside them. The tell is a new boolean on the row that only
  one caller consults.
- **When a claim is retracted, the retraction has to reach every place that made it.** After
  agreeing that C3-3 concludes nothing, the committed tree still had a docstring calling a
  positive result "conclusive", a design paragraph saying the same, and a function still
  describing its output as "wire order" — the exact phrase the round had just established the
  instrument cannot deliver. The behaviour was right and the authoritative text was a round
  behind. **Grep for the retracted claim, not just the changed function**; a reviewer reading
  the docs gets the old answer, and so does the next person to touch the code.
- **A tool that only prints its findings has not reported them.** The malformed-request events
  were written to a temp log, and `probe()` carried only the timeline — so without `-v` a
  client sending malformed frames produced no finding in the summary and no effect on the exit
  status. **Anything that changes the interpretation of a run has to reach the result object
  and the exit code**, not just a file someone might read.
- **An ON-DEMAND reader cannot observe arrival order, and moving the log is not enough.**
  Telling those two id-repeats apart is a question about the order messages crossed the
  stream. Three attempts: logging from the main loop gave *processing* order; moving the log
  into the read helper looked like the fix and was not, because the helper is still only
  called when the loop wants a line — so outside the artificially held window the shim
  answered the current request before asking for more input, and two requests that both
  crossed before the response was written were logged `req, resp, req`. **Nothing that reads
  on demand can know when bytes it has not asked for arrived**; the only fix is to drain
  continuously, which here means a reader thread. Fourth time C3 has been bitten by a buffer
  between the wire and the code reporting on it, and the *first* time the buffer was the
  program's own control flow rather than an I/O layer.

  The related trap in the same change: `verify` covered only the case where the shim happens
  to drain continuously anyway (inside the delay window), so every check passed over the
  defect. **When a fix depends on a code path being taken, check the path where it is NOT.**
- **Record an outbound event AFTER the write, not before.** `response_id` was logged first, so
  a graceful closure written to a departed reader — C3-1's measured agy behaviour, where the
  write raises and nothing leaves — was recorded as an answer that never happened. Any later
  request on that id then read as post-response reuse against a response no client received.
- **A terminal verdict truncates the evidence after it.** The proxy `Fail`s on a duplicate id
  and tears the connection down, so a later reuse in the same log is traffic the rule being
  priced would never have seen. Classification has to stop where the system stops. **When
  reading a log to predict a component's behaviour, model its early exits too** — otherwise
  the reading includes a future that the component's own failure prevents.
- **A measurement of a rule must use the RULE'S OWN definition of its terms.** C3-3 asks "does
  any CLI reuse a request id", to price a rule under which `1` and `1.0` are the same id and
  `0` and `-0.0` are the same id. It deduplicated on `repr`, under which none of those pairs
  match — so the CLI whose reuse the proxy would refuse was the one the probe reported as
  clean. Same family as the `inputRequests` fixture written from the code: the check and the
  thing checked have to disagree when the thing is wrong, and they cannot if the check
  re-derives the definition instead of importing it. `request_id_key` is now exported for the
  probe, and where importing is impossible — the shim runs with only the stdlib reachable —
  the copy is asserted equal to the original on the cases that distinguish them.
- **"Absence of a positive" needs a sample size argument, and it is not the same for every
  question.** C3-2 and C3-3 ride on one run, and only one of them is settled by it: pipelining
  happens exactly once per connection, so a clean run is an answer, while an allocator that
  emitted 0 and 1 has said nothing about the fourth request. I gave both the same treatment
  because they came from the same log. **Before concluding from a negative, ask how many times
  the run gave the behaviour a chance to appear** — and if a cell exercises it more often than
  the probe did, the probe has not priced it.
- **A compound assertion can be unfalsifiable by operator precedence.** `"costs" not in t and
  "unpriced" in t or "does NOT price" in t` is `(A and B) or C`, and C was true by
  construction — a check that could not fail, written while fixing a finding about checks that
  cannot fail. Caught by reading it back rather than by running it, because it passed.
  **Parenthesize every mixed `and`/`or` in an assertion, and prefer several `check()` calls to
  one clever one**: a check whose failure mode you cannot state is not a check.
- **Refusing something legal is a cost, and it needs a price or a flag.** The same rule refuses
  a client behaviour the spec permits — id reuse after a response. §4 already knew over-strict
  is not the safe direction, and §10.5 says failing a clean cell is as much a failure as
  forwarding a definition. The honest handling is what C3-2 did for the era gate: measure the
  fleet, and if you cannot yet, say in the design that it is an unpriced strictness rather
  than writing a comment that cites a measurement which does not exist. I had one of those —
  "the monotonic counters every measured CLI uses (C3-2, §9)" — where C3-2 measured
  *pipelining* and had never looked at ids. **A citation to the right document is not a
  citation to the right measurement.**
- **Absence of a positive result is not a negative result.** The C3-2 probe printed "No CLI
  pipelined ... costs the fleet nothing" whenever no row was positive — including a run where
  every CLI failed to connect — and then contradicted itself two lines later with the list of
  what had not been measured. Same distinction the per-row classifier already drew, dropped at
  the point where the rows became a conclusion. **Any fleet-wide claim needs every row
  answered; check that the summary cannot be produced by an empty measurement.**
- **One observed message is no evidence about the next one.** The same round, twice, in
  different disguises. A cancelled id's quarantine was released once a late response had been
  *seen*, reasoning that "the request is over on both sides" — over on the client's side; the
  other side is a server the scenario author does not control, and a second straggler is no
  more nonconforming than the first was. And a negotiated legacy version was read as settling
  the era for the whole connection, when the modern revision carries the era **per request**,
  so an initialized client can still open a modern subscription and a dual-era server can
  serve both at once. Both are the same error: **summarizing a stream into a fact about the
  connection.** Before writing state that says what the peer *is*, check whether the protocol
  says it per message; and never lift a guard on the strength of one observation from the side
  the boundary exists against.
- **Ambiguity is a third answer, and it belongs in the return type.** When a server
  cancellation could name either its own legacy request or the client's modern subscription,
  the first fix searched both maps, the second picked by era flag, and both were *choosing*.
  The message carries an id and nothing else; there is no fact to choose with. Failing loudly
  is the honest outcome, and it needed the observer to be able to return an anomaly at all —
  a function typed `-> None` cannot express "I could not tell", so it will guess.
- **An instrument's regression is not its READER's regression.** `verify_mcp_fixtures.py` E13
  covers the shim that measures pipelining, and all of it stayed green over a probe that would
  have classified a CLI which died before handshaking as "modern `n/a`, exit 0" — a false
  clean result in the tool being used to justify a design decision. The classification, not
  the log, is the probe's actual output. Factor it out of `main()` so it can be driven on
  synthetic rows (E14), and treat "what does this tool PRINT" as a thing under test whenever
  the printout is the evidence for a decision.
- **An exception argued on safety grounds can be the banned technique wearing a hat.** Asked
  to scope MRTR detection to `resultType: "input_required"`, I scoped the *version* and
  skipped the discriminator, reasoning that "a mislabelled definition is still a definition".
  That argument is the structural scan restated — it says *I will look for tool-shaped things
  regardless of what the protocol says this payload is*, which is precisely what §10.6
  rejects — and it diagnosed a plain `ping` result as tool-bearing sampling. Deviating from a
  rule is sometimes right, but the burden is to show the deviation is not an instance of the
  thing the rule exists to forbid, and "it is safer" does not discharge it: unsound in the
  strict direction is still unsound.
- **A READER'S INPUT IS THE FORMAT, NOT THE WRITER'S PROMISE.** `mcp_audit.validate` was
  written against the record the proxy intends to write, so `{"triggers": {}}` raised
  `KeyError`, an array `state` raised `TypeError`, and a scalar `fired` raised on iteration —
  six shapes crashed and two more passed clean. The module exists BECAUSE the writer is under
  suspicion, which makes "the writer would never emit that" the one justification unavailable
  to it. **A crash is worse than the malformed input that caused it**: a failed cell is a
  result, and a traceback out of `verify_post_run` is an absent verdict — the outcome the
  whole section exists to make impossible, arriving through the code written to guarantee it.
  Parse first, into types, reporting every shape it cannot use; judge afterwards.
- **`x.get(k) or []` erases the difference between MISSING, NULL and EMPTY.** All three become
  "nothing on that axis", and nothing on an axis is legal — so a writer that forgot the axis
  entirely validated clean. The same idiom hid a second one: a fault point whose suppression
  list was empty read as no fault point at all, which passed exactly the arm-only run that
  case exists to reject. **Wherever absence has a meaning, check what else produces the same
  value** — this is the completion-facts lesson (§10.5.1) applied to the record's own keys,
  which is where it should have been applied first.
- **A BOOLEAN `present` FLAG THROWS AWAY THE THING BEING CHECKED.** `child_status` was parsed
  as `"child_status" in raw`, so `null`, `"fabricated"` and `true` were all a clean verdict on
  a record claiming to hold a child's exit status. `null` is the sharpest — the record asserts
  the evidence exists and carries none of it — but `true` is the one a type check still misses,
  because **`isinstance(True, int)` holds in Python**, so the obvious repair accepts a boolean
  standing in for an exit code. Presence-not-content is the same defect as
  absence-not-emptiness one level down, and it arrives the same way: a flag substituted for a
  value nobody looked at. **Preserve the value, then check it**; a sentinel distinguishes
  absent from every value JSON can carry, and a `present` boolean cannot.
- **ERASING A BAD VALUE INTO `None` HIDES IT WHEREVER ABSENCE IS LEGAL.**
  `x if isinstance(x, str) else None` turns every non-conforming value into the same `None`
  the parser uses for "not there" — so a `cause: null` under a `done` step was
  indistinguishable from a step with no cause, and the rule forbidding a cause under `done`,
  added one round earlier, never saw one. Three sibling fields used the identical idiom and
  survived only because their tags make them REQUIRED, so a different check caught the
  erasure: **coverage by accident, from the same defect.** Preserve or report; never
  substitute the absence marker for a value that was present. And the arm has to feed it
  `null`, because a valid string cannot catch a parser erasing the field before validation.
- **A payload is legal only under the tag that READS it, and that rule quantifies over every
  tagged union in the file.** `cause_forbidden` was written for completion facts and stopped
  there, leaving `anomaly` legal on any trigger and `fact`/`exception` legal on any outcome —
  fields nothing consults, which is precisely what that rule exists to reject. One rule
  widened one route at a time, again, and the tell was as advertised: the justification
  ("nothing reports what nothing looks at") never mentioned completion facts.
- **A closed set that is only checked on the way OUT is not checked.** The fault point's
  suppression targets are completion facts, but the parser accepted any string — so
  `{"suppresses": ["not_a_fact"]}` had no structural problem. It was easy to miss because the
  instance is anomalous regardless (the hook was armed), and **"anomalous for an unrelated
  reason" reads exactly like "checked"** in the output. Whenever a field's legality is implied
  by another rule already failing the run, that is the moment it needs its own check.
- **Inferring a cause from available evidence accepts contradictory records.** A `failed`
  completion fact used to be legal if SOME pairing existed, so one record could carry both a
  real group-kill failure and a fault-point suppression of that same step — two incompatible
  accounts of one operation, no problem reported. The fix is that the fact DECLARES its cause
  and the reader checks the record bears exactly that one. **"Is there evidence for this?" is
  a weaker question than "is this the evidence?"**, and the gap between them is where two
  truths sit side by side.
- **A TOTALITY assertion over a membership test is a tautology.** The first cut of the audit
  arms tried to pin "every enumerated reason has a verdict" as `all(is_clean(r) or r not in
  CLEAN_REASONS for r in EVERY_REASON)` — which is `P or not P` once you notice `is_clean(r)`
  IS `r in CLEAN_REASONS`, so it passes against any set whatsoever, including an empty one.
  Not the precedence trap above; the disjunction simply restates the function's definition.
  Where a classification is a set lookup, totality is free and therefore not worth asserting —
  what is worth asserting is the **exact set**, because the failure that matters is a sixth
  member appearing, and that is the direction nothing announces: a cell that now passes where
  it used to fail. Two arms, because the two failures are different: the set stated exactly,
  and an unenumerated reason classifying as an anomaly.
- **A mutation whose defect is a CRASH needs an arm that can catch one.** An unhashable id
  reaching `dict.pop` raises several frames from anything that could log it — which is the
  defect — but an arm that lets it propagate turns the mutation into "failed, but NOT via",
  which proves nothing and reads like a tooling problem. The arm calls through a helper that
  converts an exception into a value the assertion rejects. Same principle as the rest of §4:
  the arm has to be able to *observe* the failure it is named for.
- **One field cannot carry both WHY something stopped and WHAT HAPPENED on the way out.**
  §10.5.1 was drafted as a single closed list of "reasons an instance can end", and it read as
  complete because every entry in it was real. It was not: `client_eof → shutdown_write_failed
  → shutdown_child_killed` is one ending with three facts in it, and a single-slot reason has
  to drop two. Whichever it drops is the load-bearing one — drop the trigger and a protocol
  anomaly reads as a clean client close; drop the outcomes and a failed process-group teardown,
  which is a surviving grandchild holding a credential, is certified clean by the record meant
  to prove the opposite. The fix is two axes and a **monotonic conjunction** over both, not a
  lookup on the last event. **The tell is enumerating things that can happen at different
  phases of one lifecycle into one flat list**: ask whether two entries can be true of the same
  ending, and if they can, they are not alternatives. The second tell is asymmetry once the
  axes are split — `read_failed` had no shutdown-phase counterpart, and that missing
  `shutdown_read_failed` is the §4 defect above (a swallowed `OSError` presenting as clean EOF)
  waiting to happen in the proxy instead of the shim.
- **Totality over an enumeration says nothing about the endings that write no record.** The
  same section's verification plan was "drive every reason and check every reason has a
  verdict" — which cannot reach `SIGKILL`, a crash after the start record, or a terminator
  truncated mid-write, because in each the process that would name a reason is already gone.
  Those need the absence rule (a start with no well-formed terminator is an anomaly) and their
  own cases, half of them driven against the *reader* with synthetic logs rather than against
  the program. A closed enumeration is evidence about the endings that can speak.
- **A LIST OF EXCEPTIONS IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT ANYTHING RAN.** The two-axis fix defined an empty
  cleanup-outcome list as "every step did what it promised" — but every outcome in it records
  something going *wrong*, so a teardown that skipped its process-group kill outright raises
  nothing, records nothing, and satisfies a verdict computed from the reasons alone. The thing
  being certified clean is a surviving credential-bearing grandchild: the exact failure the
  step exists to prevent, passed by the record that was supposed to prove it did not happen.
  The fix is **positive completion facts** — each step records `done` or `not_applicable` with
  its justification, and *missing* is an anomaly, because a step that reported nothing cannot
  be told apart from a step that never ran. **Whenever absence is given a meaning, check
  whether two different situations produce it**; here a blank meant both "did not apply" and
  "did not happen". And since a completion fact is the implementation's own claim about itself,
  one case has to verify it from outside the process — the group really gone, checked by the
  driver, not asserted by the proxy.
- **"EVERY recorded X is clean" is TRUE when nothing was recorded.** The fix above made the
  verdict a conjunction over the triggers, the outcomes and the completion facts — and every
  clause of it is universally quantified, so a terminator with an empty trigger list satisfies
  all of them. That is not a clean instance, it is a broken writer, and the verdict said clean.
  Any `all()` needs a **structural clause first**: the collections that must be non-empty are
  non-empty, every required field is present, every value is from its closed set. Owned by the
  *reader*, not the writer — a process broken enough to emit the malformed record is the wrong
  one to ask whether it did. And the validator needs the **legal record that resembles an
  illegal one** among its cases (here `spawn_failed`, whose facts are genuinely inapplicable),
  or "reject everything" passes the whole suite. Same rule as the arms: state what a broken
  implementation produces, then check the assertion rejects it — `all([])` is the purest form
  of an assertion that cannot fail.
- **An outside observer can only assert what it can observe — the C3-3 lesson, second
  instance.** The external check on teardown was written as "confirms the direct child was
  reaped", which no other process can establish: a proxy that exits without reaping leaves a
  child that init adopts and reaps, and afterwards the two are identical. The load-bearing
  property is narrower and *is* observable — **nothing from the instance is still alive** — so
  that is what the case claims. Prefer **monotone evidence over a probe**: an inherited pipe
  whose EOF proves every holder is gone cannot race the proxy's exit and cannot be fooled by a
  PID recycled under `kill(pid, 0)`. Then check the discriminating power of the fixture itself
  — a helper that exits on its own, or on stdin EOF, lets a proxy that skipped the group kill
  pass on the helper's good manners rather than on its own behaviour.
- **The EVIDENCE CHANNEL has a premise, and it needs its own positive check.** The teardown case
  proves "nothing survived" by reading EOF on a pipe inherited into the child's group — sound,
  and worthless if the descriptor never arrived. A broken `pass_fds`, or a helper that closes
  the writer at startup, produces an immediate EOF and a passing case with nothing torn down.
  So the helper writes a **distinctive readiness token** through that same pipe and holds the
  writer for life, and the driver requires the token, then requires **no EOF before shutdown
  starts**, and only then treats EOF as the finding. The token must be the helper's own, or the
  child's liveness is accepted as the helper's. Third instance of one pattern in this PR: a
  check that passes hardest when nothing happened — first in the proxy's outcome list, then in
  the verdict's quantifiers, then in the instrument built to catch the first two.
- **A liveness signal is about WHOEVER holds it, not about who you meant.** The readiness token
  above proves the helper *once* held the pipe; it says nothing about who holds it now, because
  every process on the inheritance path got a copy. A helper that writes its token and closes
  its writer then survives undetected: the ancestors keep the pipe open, the pre-shutdown check
  sees no EOF, and the EOF arrives later for the wrong reason. Attribution needs a **sole
  holder** — each stage closes its copy as soon as it has passed it on, the driver's own close
  included, or EOF never arrives at all and the case hangs instead of passing.
- **A NEGATIVE observation is only about the subject once every other candidate is gone.** The
  negative control above requires "no EOF" to mean "the helper survived" — but non-EOF only
  ever means *somebody* holds a writer, so taken too early it is satisfied by an ancestor and
  proves nothing. Two defects then cancel: a helper that closes its writer early and survives,
  plus a proxy that keeps its copy until exit, gives a positive case passing on the proxy's
  exit and a control passing on the proxy's copy, with the survivor invisible to both. Fixing
  it is ordering, not extra assertions — wait for every ancestor to exit, *then* observe.
  **Ask what else could satisfy a negative observation, and eliminate those first**; and close
  with the positive (kill the group, require EOF), so the control cannot pass by observing
  nothing at all.
- **TWO ENUMERATIONS DESCRIBING THE SAME EVENT MUST BE ABLE TO AGREE.** The completion facts
  could say `done`, `not_applicable`, or nothing — and nothing was defined as malformed. But the
  outcome axis already had `shutdown_reap_failed` and `shutdown_group_kill_failed`, which are
  those same steps running and failing, and there was **no legal way to say so on the fact
  side**. A record of a failed teardown could not be written at all. The fix is a `failed` state
  paired to its outcome, closed in **both** directions — a `failed` fact requires its outcome
  and the outcome requires the fact — because a validator checking one direction lets the writer
  record the failure on whichever axis it prefers and stay silent on the other. **When one thing
  is described by two enumerations, enumerate the cross-product, not each list alone**; the
  missing cell is where a real state ends up unwriteable.
- **A CATCH-ALL has to be reachable from every case it claims to cover.** `shutdown_anomaly` was
  defined as an exception escaping *any* teardown step, and then paired with only the two facts
  that had no typed outcome — so an exception during the drain, the reap or the group kill had
  no legal way to be recorded, which is the same unwriteable-state defect as the round before,
  found in the mechanism added to prevent it. A catch-all is only a catch-all if the pairing
  rule quantifies the way its definition does. It also needs its scope pinned: the anomaly
  carries the step it escaped, and the validator requires that step to match the fact claiming
  it, or one catch-all excuses a failure anywhere in the record.
- **CONFIGURED IS NOT FIRED, AND ONE FACT CANNOT BE BOTH.** The rule that a suppressed step
  reads `failed(fault_point_configured)` let *arming* justify the claim that a step was
  suppressed — and, read in the other direction, made a genuinely unfired hook structurally
  invalid. Those are exactly the two states the no-op-injection case exists to tell apart, so
  the pairing rule destroyed the test it was written alongside. Arming is a start-record fact
  and is anomalous **on its own**; firing is per-fact evidence and is the only thing a `failed`
  completion may pair with. **When a check needs a hook's activation, ask whether the record it
  reads proves activation or merely intent** — and check that the isolating case can still go
  green when the clause under test is deleted, or it is pinning something else.
- **A PAIRING KEY MUST BE AS FINE-GRAINED AS THE THING IT PAIRS.** The catch-all outcome was
  keyed by step number, and step 2 owns two completion facts — so one `shutdown_anomaly(step=2)`
  raised by closing stdin would license `drain_ended: failed` as well, or instead. The check
  "the step matches the fact" cannot see the difference, so it passes for the wrong reason,
  which is worse than not having it: it reads like coverage. The key is now the exact fact, and
  the sibling case is pinned in both directions. **The tell is a key whose value set is smaller
  than the set of things it identifies** — look for a table row that names two things, and for
  a cross-check written against the coarser of two available identifiers.
- **Evidence that only one actor can hold must be structurally tied to that actor's claim.**
  `child_status` is obtainable only by the process that reaped the child, so it is required
  exactly when `child_reaped` says `done` and forbidden otherwise. Left loose, a writer can
  claim the reap while lacking the one thing a reaper necessarily has, or attach a status to a
  child it never reaped. The observation that fabricating it would be *a lie rather than an
  omission* was already in the design as a remark — **a remark about what a liar would have to
  do is not a check**; make the reader enforce it.
- **A control that suppresses a step must suppress everything downstream that DEPENDS on it.**
  The control leaves the child alive on purpose, so it also has to suppress the reap — a live
  child cannot be reaped, and a control that stopped at "don't kill" would hang or crawl to the
  terminator through a give-up path, reporting a reap failure for a reap never attempted. Ask
  what the suppressed step was supposed to *produce*, then follow the consumers.
- **A FIX APPLIED TO ONE INSTRUMENT MUST BE STATED AS A RULE, OR THE NEXT ONE ARRIVES WITHOUT
  IT.** The helper channel was given a two-sided proof — announce, then no-premature-EOF, then
  a control that keeps the holder alive — and the very next round added a *second* channel for
  the child carrying the identical unverified premise: never passed to the child, EOF at once,
  accepted as proof the child had exited. The defect and its fix were on the same page. What
  stopped it recurring was writing the requirement as a quantified rule over **every** liveness
  channel instead of as two repairs, and then noticing the rule now also demands a control for
  the child. This is `CLAUDE.md`'s first rule, and the tell is exactly as advertised: the
  justification for the helper channel's fix never mentioned helpers.
- **An IDENTIFIER is not an OBSERVATION.** Having specified that the driver waits for the direct
  child to exit, I wrote that it "takes" the child from the audit log's spawn record — which
  supplies a pid, not a death. The driver cannot `wait()` a process it did not spawn; a
  liveness probe on the pid is point-in-time and recycles; and the terminator's `child_reaped`
  is the claim the case exists to test, so leaning on it is circular. The fix is the same
  mechanism one level shallower — a second inherited pipe, scoped to the child and not passed
  to the helper, whose EOF is external evidence of the child's exit. **When a step says "wait
  for X", check that the driver can observe X at all**, rather than that it can name X.
- **Two independent reports of the same identity must be cross-checked before either is acted
  on.** The helper reports its process group; the proxy reports the child's. Believing one
  without the other lets the control pass against the wrong group entirely — a mis-grouped
  helper `READY`s, survives, gets cleaned up, and the child's actual group, the only thing
  step 4 is supposed to kill, was never under test. So the two must agree, and the child must
  satisfy `pid == pgid` under `start_new_session=True`; disagreement fails the case rather
  than being reconciled, and only the vouched-for group is ever signalled.
- **Cleanup targets come from the thing being cleaned up, never from discovery.** The control
  has to kill a group it deliberately left running, and the only non-guessing source for that
  group id is the process in it — so the helper reports its own PGID in its readiness record,
  along with a driver-supplied nonce that stops a leftover helper from answering for this run.
  Anything else is the driver deciding for itself which processes belong to the run, which is
  how the `rmtree(dirname(cwd))` fixture above deleted its own working tree. The driver also
  refuses to signal its own group or an ancestor's, for the same reason.
- **A detector is worth what its negative control is worth.** "The helper holds the descriptor
  for life" and "every ancestor closed its copy" are fixture assertions, and the previous three
  findings are all about assertions nobody made the code demonstrate. So one case **suppresses
  the group kill on purpose** and requires that the survivor be reported — the only arrangement
  that tells a channel attributing survival to the helper apart from one reporting on whatever
  ancestor still holds a copy. This is `mutate_mcp.py`'s argument applied to a fixture: an
  instrument that has never been shown failing is an instrument nobody has tested. Whatever the
  control leaves running, the driver must then clean up — a test for leaked credential-bearing
  processes that leaks one has picked the wrong side of its own point.
- **A closed key set is closed in BOTH directions, and only one of them gets tested.** The
  structural validator was specified as "every completion fact present, every value from its
  closed set" — which a validator iterating the names it already knows satisfies while ignoring
  a fact added later. Missing keys are the case everyone writes; **unrecognized keys are how the
  next field silently stops being checked**, the same drift the "no default-clean branch" rule
  exists to stop on the value side. Pin both, and pin them per key rather than once for the set.
- **A count restated in prose beside the table it counts will be wrong.** Twice in one PR: the
  section's first draft said "seven reasons" of an eleven-row table, and "three facts" of the
  four that `spawn_failed` makes inapplicable. Both were counting rows, not entries, and both
  read fine. The fix is not a more careful count, it is **not restating it** — "every
  child-and-group fact" cannot drift, and re-derives itself when the table changes. Same rule as
  the verification-block counts in §4, applied to prose.
- **A test-only hook is a verdict input, or it is a way to pass without being tested.** The
  fault-injection point that lets the driver reach the endings with no reason was specified as
  "recorded in the start record", which sounds like it closes the hole and does not: if the
  fault is armed and never fires, the trigger is clean, the outcomes are clean, and the stated
  verdict formula passes a run whose whole purpose was to fail. The **configuration** is the
  anomalous fact, not the firing — and there is a case for the no-op injection specifically,
  because the failure mode is a hook that quietly does nothing.
- **A STEP ORDER CAN ENCODE A CORRECTNESS PROPERTY, AND THE OBVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION BREAKS IT
  SILENTLY.** §10.5 says terminate the group (step 4) *before* reaping the child (step 5), which
  reads like tidiness and is not: the group is named by the child's pid, and that pid stops
  being unique the instant it is reaped, so `killpg` after `wait()` names a group the kernel may
  have reassigned. Holding the child as an unreaped **zombie** through step 4 is the whole
  mechanism. Then the constraint propagates upward in a way nothing warned about — step 3 may
  not call `wait()` either, and `os.waitid(..., WNOWAIT)`, the POSIX way to wait without
  consuming, **is not available on macOS**. **When a design fixes an order, ask what property
  the order buys and then check every call that could violate it**, because the violating
  version passes every test and differs only in which processes it signals.
- **AN ERRNO IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A MEANING.** `killpg` returns `EPERM` on macOS for a group
  whose members are all zombies, where Linux returns 0 — and this proxy deliberately keeps a
  zombie in that group, so reading `EPERM` as failure reports `shutdown_group_kill_failed` on
  **every clean shutdown on one of the two supported platforms**. That is the false-failure half
  of §10.5's rule, and it is the half that is easy to write while feeling careful. The check is
  the same one the C3 probes exist for: before treating a return value as evidence, produce it
  on purpose and look.
- **A BOUND BELONGS TO THE STEP THAT OWNS THE WAIT, NOT TO EACH STEP THAT TOUCHES IT.** The
  drain (step 2) and the escalation (step 3) were bounded separately, so a server that merely
  needed `SIGKILL` — an outcome §10.5.1 classifies **clean** — had its drain time out first and
  came out as a teardown anomaly. Two timers over one wait always disagree about something. The
  tell is two steps asking the same question of the same descriptor.
- **NON-BLOCKING ON ONE END OF A PIPE IS NOT NON-BLOCKING.** `signal.set_wakeup_fd` requires the
  *write* end to be non-blocking and says nothing about the read end, so the sweep that collects
  signals arriving during the teardown blocked forever on an empty pipe — after every clean
  shutdown. No terminator was written, so the absence rule reported an anomaly for a run that
  had done everything right. The failure only shows on the path that reads an *empty* channel,
  which is the ordinary path; every case with something to read passed.
- **AN INSTRUMENT MUST NOT BE COUPLED TO THE THING IT OBSERVES.** The credential-bearing helper
  inherited the proxy's stderr, which is a descriptor the *driver* holds — so the driver's read
  of it blocked until the helper exited, and the helper is precisely the process the case needs
  to still be running. A liveness test that deadlocks on its subject surviving proves nothing.
  Fixed on both sides: the helper gets `DEVNULL`, and the driver gives the proxy a stderr
  **file** rather than a pipe, because anything in the group can hold a pipe open.
- **A CONTROL CAN PASS ON THE FIXTURE'S MANNERS — SECOND INSTANCE, ONE LEVEL DOWN.** The rule
  was already written for the helper ("must survive everything except a group signal"), and the
  control then failed because the *child* exited on stdin close and EOF'd its own channel. The
  suppressed steps were never under test. The fixture now closes stdout while staying alive, so
  the drain settles cleanly and the only anomalies in the record are the injected ones. Same
  quantifier lesson as the liveness channels: the rule was about one participant when it was
  about every participant.
- **THE INSTRUMENT FOR "A READ ERROR THAT IS NOT EOF" HAS TO PRODUCE AN OBSERVABLE ERROR.** Two
  obvious arrangements do not: a directory as stdin makes CPython refuse to start (`<stdin> is
  a directory, cannot continue`), so the proxy never reaches its own boundary and there is no
  log at all; a pty whose master is closed reads as **plain EOF** on macOS, which is the very
  thing the case must distinguish itself from. **Check that the failure you are injecting
  arrives at the layer you are testing**, rather than upstream of it — which is also how the
  next two candidates were rejected: a write-only *regular file* as stdin is never reported
  ready by kqueue, so the proxy blocks and the case times out, and `/dev/null` opened write-only
  makes `kevent` itself fail, so the error surfaces in the pump's catch-all rather than in the
  read handler the case is about. What works is the **write end of a pipe whose reader is
  already closed**: ready to select, `EBADF` to read, and — unlike the loopback socket with
  `SO_LINGER {1, 0}` it replaces — it needs no network, which is what made the whole file
  unrunnable under a sandbox that denies `bind()` (review, PR #103). **An instrument that needs
  a privilege is an instrument some reviewer cannot run**, and a suite nobody else can run is
  evidence nobody else can check.
- **CLASSIFYING BY THE WRONG AXIS SURVIVES UNTIL THE THIRD CASE.** `mutate_mcp.py` derived a
  mutation's class (`M` production / `I` selftest / `F` instrument) from *which suite proves
  it*, which agreed with the file's role for as long as there were two suites. The third suite
  broke it in both directions at once: `mcp_proxy_io.py` is production proven by a driver, and
  `proxy_target_server.py` is an instrument proven by the same driver. "What does this perturb?"
  and "who would notice?" are two questions, and only the first determines which total a
  mutation belongs in. A derivation that has never been wrong is not the same as a correct one.
- **AN UNTESTED PATH THAT NOBODY SAYS IS UNTESTED READS AS TESTED.** Three cleanup outcomes —
  `shutdown_read_failed`, `shutdown_reap_failed`, `shutdown_group_kill_failed` — cannot be
  arranged from outside the proxy at all, so the driver reaches them through the fault point's
  `fail` mode. That drives the **record** and not the code that would produce it in the wild.
  The driver says so in its own header, and §10.9 says so too, because "every outcome driven"
  is otherwise a claim about coverage the file does not have.
- **AN ERRNO WITH MORE THAN ONE CAUSE IS NOT EVIDENCE — the `EPERM` lesson, corrected.** §4
  already said "produce it on purpose and look", and I did: macOS returns `EPERM` from `killpg`
  for an all-zombie group where Linux returns 0. What that establishes is ONE cause, not an
  equivalence, and `kill(2)` defines the errno as the inability to signal group members — which
  a sandbox restriction or a differently credentialed descendant also produces, either of them
  leaving a live member while the branch certified success. **A measurement licenses the
  direction it measured, never the converse.** The fix is not a better errno reading but
  positive evidence: deliver the signal while the group is provably ours, then confirm
  emptiness after the reap with a signal-0 probe, whose worst outcome is a false failure.
- **DETECTION IS NOT CLEANUP.** The absence rule catches a proxy killed before its teardown and
  fails the cell — and the credential-bearing server it was fronting is still running, because
  `start_new_session=True` put it out of reach of every ancestor's group kill. Recording an
  ending is not ending it. The fix is a **guardian**: a third process in its own session
  holding a lifeline, which kills the child's group when the proxy dies.
- **CONTAINMENT THAT IS OPTIONAL, LATE, OR ANONYMOUS IS NOT CONTAINMENT — one review round, three
  faults, one fix.** The guardian above was spawned *after* the child, was "best effort" so a
  failure to start let the run continue, and signalled a bare pgid it could not show was still
  the group it created. Each looks like a separate hardening job and each was a consequence of
  the same structural choice: the guardian was a bystander. Making it the child's **parent**
  answers all three at once — it cannot be late because it is what starts the server, it cannot
  be absent because no guardian means no spawn (`spawn_failed`, fail closed), and it holds the
  group's identity because an **unreaped member pins the pgid against reuse** and only a parent
  can hold one. The general rule: when three defenses of one property each need their own
  patch, the property is being defended from the wrong place. Corollaries worth keeping:
  - **A pin, not a probe.** `killpg(pgid, 0)` succeeding says something is there, not that it is
    *yours*. Only an unreaped member establishes that, so every real signal goes through the
    process holding one — and that process stops signalling the moment it reaps, because
    releasing the pin ends its licence to act. A probe that delivers nothing is the one group
    operation that stays sound without a pin, which is why the emptiness check is signal 0.
  - **Readiness is a handshake, not a return value.** `Popen` returning says a fork succeeded.
    The guardian reports its own pid, the proxy checks it against the process it spawned, and
    the spawn record — which the reader now REQUIRES to carry it — is written only afterwards.
    An optional field whose value nothing validated stayed clean with it missing, `false`, and
    `"alive"`.
- **CLEANING UP AFTER A FAILURE DOES NOT ERASE THE EVIDENCE OF IT.** The guardian stood down
  whenever the proxy's teardown had merely **run**, on the reasoning that a group kill which was
  attempted and failed should leave its survivors for §10.9's liveness cases to observe. That
  reasoning is wrong, and the shape of the error is worth more than the case: the audit record
  already holds the failure, so the survivors were not the evidence — they were a leak with a
  justification attached. The rule is that the record carries the evidence and the mechanism
  carries the cleanup, and only an **explicitly armed test-only control** may retain a process.
  That distinction is exactly why the fault point has separate `suppress` and `fail` modes, and
  both directions are now driven: firing retains, failing sweeps.
- **A GUARANTEE MUST BE STATED AT THE WIDTH OF ITS MECHANISM.** "Nothing from this instance is
  still alive" was the claim; a process group was the mechanism; and a descendant that calls
  `setsid()` leaves the group and survives a clean run unreported. There is no portable
  containment stronger than a process group on both supported platforms, so the claim was the
  thing that had to move. The limit is now driven as a case that asserts what actually happens
  — clean verdict, `group_terminated: done`, helper alive — because **a documented boundary
  nothing checks outdates itself quietly**, and this one fails loudly if containment is widened.
- **A RULE ENFORCED AT ONE FIELD IS A RULE ABOUT THAT FIELD.** `NaN`/`Infinity` were "refused"
  only because `valid_request_id` rejects a NaN id; nothing looked anywhere else in a message,
  because Python's JSON decoder accepts all three as a documented extension. The check belongs
  at the decoder (`parse_constant`), which is the one place that quantifies over the message.
  Same shape in the framing: an empty line, undecodable bytes and a partial line at EOF were
  each skipped by a different guard written for a different purpose — `strip()`,
  `errors="replace"`, and an EOF path that discarded its buffer — and each produced a clean
  verdict for a stream that had gone wrong. **`errors="replace"` on a boundary is a rewrite,
  not a tolerance**: it forwards bytes the peer never sent.
- **"HAS SOMETHING GONE WRONG" IS NOT "DID THIS GO WRONG HERE".** The drain stopped on
  `if self.triggers`, which is always true during a teardown — there is already the trigger
  that started it — so a malformed frame arriving on the way out was recorded as an anomaly and
  then followed by more forwarding. The terminality test has to be a **count compared across
  the call**, not a truthiness test on an accumulator. The tell is a guard that reads state
  which the surrounding phase guarantees is already set.
- **A GRAMMAR IS AN ORDERING, SO CHECK IT AS ONE.** The log reader checked that the start record
  came first and nothing else, which accepted `start → terminator → spawn` and
  `start → spawn → terminator → event` as clean — a terminator that does not terminate, with
  work recorded after the record on which the absence rule, the no-heal rule and every
  completion fact rest. One rank per line kind and "the sequence is sorted" cannot disagree with
  itself about a case, where a hand-written first-record test only ever covers the end someone
  thought about.
- **AN ARCHIVED ARTIFACT MUST CARRY ENUMERATED REASONS, NOT PROSE.** The dropped-message event
  logged the decision layer's human-readable reason, which quotes the request id — an arbitrary
  wire value of any length and content the peer chose. `Drop` now carries a **code** from a
  closed set for the log and its prose for stderr, and the reader validates the code against
  that set. The tell is a field the writer formats and the reader accepts as any non-empty
  string.
- **THE OBVIOUS TYPE CHECK ADMITS THE VALUE THAT IS NOT A VALUE — third instance.** `isinstance(
  True, int)` was the first, `null` under a present-but-unread optional the second, and
  `isinstance(float("nan"), float)` the third: a timestamp reader accepted `NaN` and `Infinity`,
  which are floats and are not times. Same as the first two, the check has to name the property
  the field is *for* — finite, here — and not the type that carries it. Note the value arrives
  by two routes and both needed closing: the decoder produces it from a bare `NaN` token unless
  told not to, so the log reader now refuses those constants with the same `parse_constant` the
  wire does, imported rather than restated.
- **A TOTALITY CHECK IS BLIND TO EVERY CASE BELOW IT.** "Every reason in the enumeration was
  actually produced" sat at the end of its own section, where it quantified over the runs above
  it and nothing else. It passed the day a new trigger was added and driven two sections
  further down, and would have kept passing had the case been deleted. A fleet-wide claim goes
  **last in the file**, for the same reason a fleet-wide negative requires every row answered.
- **A MUTATION THAT REDDENS THE RECORD CHECKS WHILE THE LIVENESS CHECKS STAY GREEN IS A
  MUTATION AIMED ONE LEVEL AWAY FROM THE DEFECT.** Two arrived in one round. Removing step 4
  left the group alive in the record but not in fact, because the reap order sweeps it too;
  neutering the guardian's watch loop made it exit, which the proxy reads as `guardian_lost`
  and cleans up from. Both are the M53/M270 pattern — a property defended in two places needs
  a mutation that removes **both** — and the tell is the same each time: the intended arm is
  green and a dozen unintended ones are red.
- **A MUTATION MUST NOT BE ABLE TO DO MORE DAMAGE THAN THE DEFECT IT MODELS.** This one cost a
  developer machine, so it is written down at the length it earned.
  M289 replaced the guardian's EOF exit with `continue`. With the lifeline at EOF the descriptor
  is always readable, so the mutant's wait became a busy loop — in a process that is its own
  session leader with no parent to reap it. **24 orphans at ~35% CPU each accumulated across
  three runs, load average 186**, unnoticed until someone opened Activity Monitor. A mutant is
  broken code by construction, so the bound a mutation removes may be the process's only way
  out; that is a constraint on how mutations are WRITTEN.
  The first fix made it worse. A `ps`-scanning reaper was added to the runner to kill anything
  still executing out of the work tree — a process-killing loop in a test tool — and then, to
  prove the reaper did not over-reach, a mutation that **deleted its filter**: `kill(SIGKILL)`
  over every line of `ps ax`, which is every process the user owns. It was inert only because
  its anchor accidentally matched the mutation table rather than the function, and the next
  commit "fixed" the anchor. Both the reaper and its mutation are gone. Three rules came out of
  it, and the third is the one that matters:
  - a mutation of a loop exit must leave the process able to exit, checked by reading it before
    it is added;
  - `substring in command` matches EVERY process when the substring is empty, so any predicate
    that selects processes to kill needs its blast radius bounded before the first candidate is
    read — not as defence against a defect anyone made, but because the failure mode is
    unbounded while the purpose is narrow;
  - **when the tooling that verifies safety becomes the most dangerous code in the tree, delete
    it rather than making it safer.** The leak had already been fixed at its source; the reaper
    was insurance against a class of mistake that should not be made in the first place, and it
    bought that insurance with a `kill` loop running unattended for an hour at a time.
- **A DIAGNOSTIC MUST NEVER BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE ACTION IT DESCRIBES.** The guardian's sweep
  announced itself before signalling, and stderr is inherited from the CLI — so with that pipe
  closed the `print` raised `BrokenPipeError` and a credential-bearing process group survived,
  killed by nothing because its executioner stopped to write a log line. The reproduction was
  one function; the rule quantifies over **every** stderr write in the program, so all of them
  go through a helper that swallows `OSError` and `ValueError`, and the sweep additionally acts
  before it speaks so the ordering says what the helper guarantees. The general shape: **an
  I/O call on a channel you do not own, placed on a path that must complete.**
- **A LOUD ANOMALY DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ACTING ON AN UNCERTAIN IDENTITY.** The `guardian_lost`
  path signalled the remembered pgid after checking `getpgid(child_pid) == child_pgid` — a
  check whose own docstring admitted a reaped pid can be reused, and which for a group leader
  degenerates to "some group leader has this number". Recording the ending honestly does not
  make the signal safe: the two are independent. The path now refuses to signal and records the
  failure, and §10.6 carries the surviving server as a **limit** rather than a branch. The tell
  is a guard documented as weak and then used as though it were strong.
- **A PARTITION THE RECORD ASSERTS MUST BE A PARTITION THE CODE ENFORCES.** `spawn_failed` meant
  "no server ran", four `not_applicable` facts said so, and the audit was observably false: the
  guardian spawned the child and reported readiness in one step, so a report the proxy REJECTED
  still left a `/usr/bin/touch` child that had created its marker — 6 runs in 20. The fix is
  structural rather than defensive: two phases, and a guardian that has not been accepted is
  never told what to run. Note where the error was — not in the record, which reported what it
  could see, but in an implementation that drew the boundary one step later than the document.
- **WHEN THE END-TO-END WITNESS IS A RACE, FIND A SECOND ONE THAT IS NOT.** The marker file
  above catches a regression about one time in twenty, because the wrongly-spawned child is
  killed within a millisecond or two — a detector that misses 95% of the time is not a check,
  it is a coin. The deterministic witness was already available and one line away: have the
  process under suspicion **say which phase it reached**, on a channel the driver already reads,
  and pair the run that must stop early with one that must go further. Two rules met there — a
  claim and its subject must not share an author (the guardian reports on the proxy's
  behaviour), and an absent string proves nothing without a run in which it is present.
- **A FIELD CARRIED RAW OWES A TOTAL PREDICATE.** The audit reader's contract is that arbitrary
  decoded JSON produces a verdict and never an exception, and `[] in FROZENSET` raises
  `TypeError: unhashable type`. Every field the validator looks up in a closed set is narrowed
  to a string by the parser first — except the two carried **raw**, because for them "present
  but wrong" is a different verdict from "absent". `child_status` survived by accident:
  `is_json_int` is an `isinstance` check and so total over any value. The guardian injection was
  the same shape with a set lookup, and `"guardian": []` crashed `log_verdict`, which is the
  function that decides whether a gated cell passed — **a crash there is not a failed cell, it
  is no verdict at all**. Two things to carry forward. The rule is *the predicate must be total*,
  not *this field needs an isinstance*; and the regression arm drives an unhashable value
  through **every** membership-tested position rather than the one that broke, because what
  makes the other nine safe is a parser invariant, and an invariant nothing drives is a comment.
  The rule was already written down twice in the same tree — over `kind` in the log reader and
  in `valid_request_id` — which is what makes this a *third* instance rather than a discovery:
  a rule stated at one site is a rule about that site.
- **AN OUTCOME THAT NAMES AN ACT IS WRITTEN ONLY WHERE THE ACT HAPPENED.** `shutdown_child_killed`
  says this instance delivered a `SIGKILL`; step 3's escalation wrote it whether or not
  `_deliver` reported success. The ending that exposed it is the one whose policy is to signal
  **nothing** — guardian gone, no pin, delivery refused — so the archived log recorded a kill
  beside the two failures proving nothing was signalled. Step 4 had read that same return value
  since the day it was written. The tell is a call whose result is discarded on one path and
  consulted on another, when both paths record what the call did. Two corollaries:
  - The escalation now **ends** on the refusal rather than trying the next order — the only
    process that could signal is gone, so the second order fails identically and the message
    after the loop would then claim a kill was delivered.
  - Making step 3's loop read the return value made it **textually identical to step 4's**, so
    two mutation anchors silently became ambiguous — which is what turned up the next entry.
- **AN AMBIGUOUS MUTATION ANCHOR IS A MUTATION THAT HAS QUIETLY STOPPED TESTING WHAT IT NAMES.**
  `mutate_mcp.py` applies `original.replace(find, repl, 1)`, so an anchor matching twice still
  produces a mutant, still reddens some arm, and still prints `CAUGHT` — while perturbing
  whichever site is earlier in the file. **Five entries were in this state**, and the run was
  green throughout: M7 (the `str` redactor's loop, identical to its `bytes` twin), M184, M187,
  M217, M269. Four of them are the leading-newline lesson already recorded three bullets down —
  a 4-space anchor is a substring of the same line indented 8 — **which nothing enforced**, so
  it had been true since the day it was written down. The fix is therefore not five edits but
  the guard beside the stale-anchor check: an anchor matching a number of times other than one
  is **refused, not warned**, and a refused mutation is uncaught, so the suite exits non-zero.
  Two general points worth more than the five:
  - **A rule written in a lessons file is not enforced by having been written.** This one had
    been, verbatim, and four entries violated it anyway. If a rule is checkable, the check is
    the artifact; the prose is a comment on it.
  - **The failure mode of an instrument is not the failure mode of the code it tests.** A
    mutation suite whose count is unchanged can still have lost coverage — the sibling of
    "fewer mutations than last time" in §4's header, and the harder one to see, because the
    number that would have told you is the one that stayed the same.
  Note what the guard does **not** claim: it pins each mutation to one site, and it does not
  say the other site is covered. Four of the five siblings — the `bytes` redactor's loop,
  `parse_log`'s per-line map check, `instance_verdict`'s `anomalous`, and `_pump`'s in-loop
  signal handler — have no mutation of their own. M187's pair was merged into one tuple edit
  because `_str_or` and `_opt_str` are the same rule (M53's pattern); the other three are a
  coverage question, recorded here rather than answered.
- **A SHAPE CAPTURED FROM A WRITER IS NOT A CLAIM ABOUT A READER.** §9 probe #1 asked whether
  claude accepts the `{"type","url","headers"}` config the adapter writes. `claude mcp add
  --transport http` writes exactly that shape for itself, which is authoritative — about
  `.mcp.json`, the project-scope file. The adapter uses `--mcp-config`, **a different entry
  point**, and "they share a parser" was an assumption of precisely the kind a probe exists to
  remove. Both were measured; both agreed; the point is that agreeing was a finding rather than
  a foregone conclusion.
- **THE STATED QUESTION WAS NARROWER THAN THE ONE THAT MATTERED, and the gap held the
  credential.** Probe #1 was written as a question about JSON shape. What §8's SlideRule
  pattern actually needs is a bearer token in `headers` **arriving at the server**, and nothing
  in the probe's wording asked that — yet a token that never arrives is a broken run presenting
  as an empty result, which is the failure mode hardest to attribute. Answering it needed a
  server that could say what it received, so the probe grew a fixture. **When a probe's
  question is about a format, ask what the format is FOR, and whether that survives the trip.**
  Two more facts fell out of the same receipts at no cost — the client's `MCP-Protocol-Version`
  header confirming C3-0 from the other side, and an in-band CLI version string on a channel
  the agent's own output cannot reach — which is the ordinary return on recording everything an
  instrument sees rather than only the field under test.
- **A VERIFIER THAT CRASHES ON THE DEFECT IT EXISTS TO DETECT REPORTS LESS THAN ONE THAT SAYS
  NOTHING — and it turned up twice in one file, at two levels.** First at startup: an unbounded
  `readline()` on a fixture that could not `bind()` returned "", every check below then raised
  `KeyError`, and a reviewer got a traceback instead of a finding. Then one level in: a mutation
  that made the fixture deny every request left `initialize` with no body, an indexing check
  raised, and the block reported ONE red check where a dozen were wrong — which read as a
  mutation escaping rather than as a verifier falling over. **Both fixes are the same shape**:
  bound the wait, keep the child's stderr, and never index a possibly-broken subject directly.
  The tell for the second one is a mutation reported "failed, but NOT via" when the defect is
  obviously in scope — the arm is fine, the driver never reached it.
- **AN INSTRUMENT MAY NEED A PRIVILEGE IT CANNOT GIVE UP, and then the obligation changes.** §4
  already said a suite needing a privilege is a suite some reviewer cannot run, and the proxy
  verifier's loopback case was redesigned to obey it. The HTTP fixture cannot be: binding a TCP
  socket IS the thing under test. So the rule it owes instead is to **fail by name, with the
  child's own stderr attached** — and the diagnostic has to survive the printer, which truncates.
  A 400-byte tail of a traceback gets cut mid-frame and names a line number; the traceback's
  LAST line names the cause. `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` is the whole
  value of preserving stderr, and taking the wrong slice of it throws that away while looking
  thorough.
- **A RENAMED CHECK SILENTLY UNHOOKS ITS MUTATION.** Rewriting a check's label during review
  left `F10` pointing at a string nothing prints; the mutation still ran, still broke the code,
  and was reported "failed, but NOT via" — visible, but only to someone reading closely. The
  arm names are a second, untyped reference to a check, so the file now ends with a sweep that
  asserts every `F*` arm names a label the suite actually printed. The general form: **when two
  artifacts refer to each other by copied string, something has to check the reference
  resolves** — the same rule as §4's pinned duplicates, applied to a name rather than a value.
- **A GUARD THAT SKIPS ITSELF ON AN EMPTY INPUT IS THE DEFECT IT WAS WRITTEN AGAINST.** The
  sweep above ran under `if printed:`, so a verifier whose output format moved out from under
  the label regex parsed **nothing** and thereby cleared **every** arm — vacuous success,
  inside the guard closing vacuous success. It is §4's `all(...)` over a collection nothing was
  put into, one file later, and it takes the same remedy: a structural clause saying something
  must be there, ahead of the universal one. Note why the wrong-arm control missed it — that
  control proves membership works against a non-empty parse and is silent about the empty one,
  which is the ordinary blind spot of a control built from a passing case.
- **A RECORD THAT GROWS A FIELD HAS TO BE RE-READ BY EVERY READER, AND A POSITIONAL ONE CANNOT
  BE.** `_SUITES` gained a third element for that same guard. Two readers were updated by
  index; `run()` still said `argv, _ = _SUITES[suite]`, so `mutate_mcp.py` raised `ValueError`
  before its first baseline and **could not start either verifier suite at all** — for a whole
  push, while the review round in flight was about the guard's finer points. The repair is not
  a third careful index but a **named record**, which no reader can mis-unpack and whose next
  field costs nobody a change; the same argument as importing a rule rather than restating it.
  The deeper half is why nothing said so: those readers were executed **only by the 63-minute
  path**, so the tool's own breakage was discovered late by construction. §4 already says a
  probe's classification is under test because its printout is the evidence; a runner's suite
  plumbing is under test for the identical reason, and it now is — `verify_mcp_fixtures.py`
  drives it in six seconds from a different program, which is also what makes `mutate_mcp.py`
  admissible as a mutation target for the first time.
- **A FIX LANDS IN THE COPY THAT WAS REVIEWED, NOT THE COPY MEANT TO BE REUSED.** The fixture
  verifier's startup was hardened — bounded wait, stderr preserved, reap on every failed
  `__enter__`. `probe_remote_mcp.py` exists precisely so the same procedure can be RE-RUN, and
  it kept parsing the port announcement inside its `return`: a first line that was not JSON
  raised out with the child alive and the caller's handle still `None`, leaking a listening
  server. **Opt-in tools are where this happens**, because "nothing routine runs it" is the
  same sentence as "nothing routine would notice". The rule that generalizes is the first one
  in `CLAUDE.md`: the justification for the verifier's fix never mentioned verifiers. Its error
  paths are now driven offline against fakes that announce garbage, announce nothing, and die —
  with the reap checked by a witness outside the function, since from the caller's side a
  correct reap and a leaked server are the same returned `None`.
- **A SCOPE NOTE THAT OVERSTATES IS WORSE THAN NO SCOPE NOTE, AND PROSE DOES NOT CHECK PROSE.**
  The HTTP fixture's header said it "implements the `2025-11-25` binding" while filing
  `MCP-Protocol-Version` under what MODERN HTTP adds. That header is required BY `2025-11-25`,
  which §9 — written days earlier, in the same PR, from this fixture's own receipts — already
  recorded the real client sending. Two files disagreed and nothing compares one paragraph to
  another. Two things came out of it. **A sentence written to disclaim one thing can claim
  another**, and the disclaimer is what a later reader trusts instead of reading the code. And
  the missing enforcement was already implied: the `Origin` fix had been justified by "a
  fixture more permissive than the spec teaches the harness that a permissive server is
  normal", an argument quantifying over **every** server-side MUST in the binding — so
  honouring it meant sweeping the rest and finding this one, rather than waiting to be told.
  What the note says now is what is served, what is not, and which list each item is on.
- **AN OBSERVATION WINDOW EQUAL TO THE SUBJECT'S LIFETIME DECIDES NOTHING, AND IT LOOKS LIKE
  FLAKINESS.** The orphan case asks whether a credential-bearing child is still alive after its
  proxy was `SIGKILL`ed. The child was told to linger `30` seconds; `at_eof` was given
  `DEADLINE`, which is `30.0`. Same number. So the child exits on its own at the exact moment
  the checker stops waiting for it, and which one happens first is scheduling noise — the check
  reddened on an idle machine and went **green under full-suite load, over a proxy that had
  swept nothing.** M289 was reported `CAUGHT` alone and "failed, but NOT via" about one full run
  in four, which reads as an unreliable mutation and is really an instrument that cannot answer
  the question it was asked.
  §4 already had "a bound belongs to the step that owns the wait" for two timers that disagree;
  this is the degenerate case where they are the SAME timer, and it has no safe side — the
  failure direction is a check going green over the defect it exists to catch. The linger is now
  `DEADLINE * 3`, **derived** rather than a literal that happens to differ, and it costs nothing
  on the green path because a working guardian sweeps the child immediately; the linger is only
  ever reached when the sweep did not happen, which is the defect. Verified by manufacturing the
  condition — every core saturated — and watching the named arm redden twice where it used to
  flip.
  Two things generalize. **A test whose result depends on which of two equal timers wins is not
  intermittent, it is undefined**, and calling it flaky is what stops anyone looking. And the
  first diagnosis was wrong in an instructive way: the two checks that reddened instead looked
  like a second defence masking the first (the M53 pattern), and the fix that follows from that
  reading — make the mutation remove both — would have left the real defect in place. Producing
  the condition on purpose is what separated them, and it took one run to do.
- **THE STATUS YOU REPORT MUST COME FROM THE COMMAND WHOSE STATUS YOU MEAN — and it went wrong
  twice in one session, in both directions.** First: four rounds of `python3 -u
  tools/mutate_mcp.py 2>&1 | tail -14` reported "exit code 0", which is `tail`'s, every time.
  The run that finally mattered returned **1** with `320/322` and was announced as a success.
  Then, having "fixed" that by capturing `$?` into an echoed line, the wrapper ended with
  `grep -c … || echo 0` — and `grep -c` exits **1** when the count is zero, so a **clean**
  322/322 run was announced as a **failure**. A false green and then a false red, from the same
  root: the last command in the script was not the command under test.
  The lesson is not "don't pipe to `tail`", which is what I wrote after the first instance and
  which is why the second one landed. It is that a status is evidence ABOUT a specific process,
  so it has to be **captured from that process** — `rc=$?` immediately after it, printed, and
  read — and every convenience wrapped around it afterwards is a different process with its own
  status. The captured line said `RUNNER EXIT: 0` and was right both times; the surrounding
  shell was wrong both times. **When a fix is a prohibition on one spelling, ask what the rule
  quantifies over**, because the next spelling is already being typed.
- **RENAMING AN ARM UNHOOKS ITS MUTATION, AND THE GUARD DID NOT COVER THE SUITE WHERE IT
  HAPPENED.** #106 added a guard for exactly this and pointed it at printed check labels — so
  it covers the two verifiers and NOT the selftest, which prints section headings rather than a
  line per arm. Changing `mcp.claude_refuses_tools_it_cannot_enforce` to its opposite therefore
  left `M4` naming a check that no longer existed, and the same edit made its find-text stale;
  the mutation reported as a **skip**, which is uncaught, and the totals moved by one in a
  number nobody reads per-line. The fix is that the arm set is recoverable from the suite's
  SOURCE even when it is not recoverable from its OUTPUT — a substring test over `selftest.py`,
  cruder than reading labels and sufficient for the case that matters. **When a guard is
  written against one representation of a fact, check whether the fact has another
  representation somewhere the guard cannot see.**
- **ADDING A SECOND SITE THAT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST IS THE OTHER WAY TO CREATE AN AMBIGUOUS
  ANCHOR.** #103 recorded this arriving from a REFACTOR that made two functions identical.
  Here it arrived from new code: `_write_proxy_config` creates its file exactly the way
  `_write_mcp_config` creates `mcp.json`, so `M9`'s anchor silently began matching twice and
  was refused. Two things worth keeping. The guard worked — a refused mutation is uncaught and
  the suite says so, which is the behaviour that entry argued for. And **the trigger is not
  refactoring, it is textual coincidence**, so the moment to check is whenever a new site is
  written in the image of an existing one, which is most of the time.
- **A REFUSAL IS AN ORDERING, AND EVERY WELL-BEHAVED CLIENT IS BLIND TO IT.** To put the
  message's method on the receipt row, I moved the body read ahead of the `Origin` check — and
  wrote a comment saying the reorder "buys two things", listing both, never asking what it
  cost. It cost the defence: a rejected cross-origin caller could then name a `Content-Length`
  this server would read, or pin a handler open by declaring a body and sending none, before
  collecting its 403. **All three `Origin` checks stayed green**, because each sends a body, so
  reading it first changes nothing they can see. The case that sees it is a hand-written
  request over a raw socket that declares 50MB and sends none, and the discriminator is
  whether an answer comes back AT ALL within a bound — not what the answer says. Two rules.
  When a security property is about ORDER, a check whose client behaves well cannot test it;
  write the misbehaving client. And **a justification that lists what a change buys and not
  what it spends is not a justification** — the first rule in `CLAUDE.md` in its other
  direction, since the argument for the reorder never mentioned refusals.
- **AN ASSERTION MUST BE ABLE TO FAIL FOR THE REASON IT NAMES — AND ONLY FOR THAT REASON.**
  §4's standing rule is that every assertion must be able to fail. Its dual arrived with the
  raw-socket case above: beside "the 403 arrived" I added "and it arrived within four seconds",
  which could not fail for the reason it named, because the socket's own five-second deadline
  already bounds the answer — a server reading the body first is still blocked when that expires
  and returns no status line at all, so the first check has the coverage. What remained was a
  check that could fail **only** for a reason it was not about: the host pausing the process.
  Zero coverage, non-zero flakiness. I had flagged it as *possibly flaky* and stopped there
  rather than asking the next question, which is the one that settles it: **name the defect this
  assertion catches that its neighbour does not.** If there is none, the assertion is a false
  failure waiting for a loaded machine. Wall-clock thresholds are where this concentrates, since
  a bound is usually already enforced somewhere by a timeout; keep the elapsed time as DETAIL,
  which explains a red check without being able to cause one.
- **THE CHECK CLOSING A FINDING WAS ANSWERED BY A DIFFERENT REQUEST — the recurring one, in
  the fix for the entry above.** "A refused request is still recorded" asked only whether some
  row carried the rejected origin. `do_GET` records before it refuses, by a different line, so
  a cross-origin GET four checks earlier had already put such a row in the file: the mutation
  removing the POST refusal's `_record` was **MISSED**, and the check passed on evidence from a
  request it was not about. The verb belonged in the assertion. Worth noting how it was found —
  not by review of the check, which reads correctly, but by the mutation written alongside it,
  which is the entire argument for writing one in the same commit.
- **AN ASSERTION WEAKER THAN THE SENTENCE IT PROTECTS IS NOT PROTECTING IT.** §9 publishes
  "every post-handshake request carries `MCP-Protocol-Version`". The check dropped the requests
  with no header and required only that one remained — so a client sending it once and omitting
  it on every later request passed, while the document kept claiming otherwise. **Read the
  published sentence and the assertion side by side**; the gap here was a filter, which is the
  usual shape, because dropping the inconvenient rows is how a per-item rule quietly becomes an
  existential one. Two things had to change with it. The exempt case must be *identified*
  rather than inferred from being the one that was missing, which is why the fixture records
  the JSON-RPC method beside the headers — and by construction, not by adjacency to the `rpc`
  rows, since a threading server interleaves them. And the check must **print its tally on a
  green run**: `check()` shows detail only when it fails and the receipts are deleted on the
  way out, so the published number was unrecoverable from a passing probe.
- **A COUNT IS AN OBSERVATION OF ONE RUN — second instance, now in a measurement.** §4 already
  said a count restated in prose beside the table it counts will be wrong. §9 published "4 of
  5 requests"; the next run measured 3 of 4, because the tally moves with how many messages the
  model happens to drive. Nothing was broken and the sentence was false. **State the rule and
  let the instrument print the number**, which is the same fix as "every child-and-group fact"
  one document over.
- **A MECHANISM BUILT TO ANSWER AN ARGUMENT DOES NOT ANSWER IT IN THE NEXT FILE.** Probe #1's
  live check that "the model calls the tool and gets its answer" read the model's final text
  for the string the tool had been asked to echo — a string the PROMPT supplied, so a client
  that advertised the tools and never invoked one passed by repeating itself. `ECHO_MCP_IDENTITY`
  exists for exactly this, added a round earlier with a comment stating exactly this argument
  ("a marker it could reconstruct from what it was already given proves nothing"). Knowing the
  rule, and having built the mechanism, did not make me reach for it in a new file. The fix
  separates two facts that were being read off one: the server's receipts say the call
  **arrived**, and the opaque marker says the answer **came back** — and the receipts cannot
  witness the second, because a server can say what it wrote and not what was read.
- **A REFUSAL THAT COVERED YOUR CASE INCIDENTALLY DISAPPEARS WHEN THE BLANKET IS LIFTED.**
  DESIGN §10 has said since it was written that remote `tools:` is out of scope, and the
  sentence was true for months without anything checking it: `mcp_tool_filter` read `"unbuilt"`
  on claude, so the validator refused **every** gated server, and the remote case was inside a
  refusal written for a different reason. Building the stdio proxy flipped that constant to
  `"proxy"` — narrowing nothing, because the constant had no way to express a narrowing — and
  the remote case walked through, spending a model call to arrive at a proxy config whose
  `command` was `null`. **When a rule you rely on is enforced only as a side effect of a
  broader one, lifting the broader one is the moment to write the specific check** — not the
  moment to trust the document that still describes the old behaviour. The tell is a constant
  answering a question whose real subject is a pair: enforceability was never a property of the
  adapter alone, since a `proxy` filter is a *program the harness launches* and what it can
  reach depends on the server. The fix is `tool_filter_for(server)`, asked per server, plus the
  same rule re-asserted in the config writer, because a validator is skippable by any caller
  that builds argv directly.
- **ABSENT AND EMPTY, ONCE MORE, IN THE GUARD RATHER THAN THE READER.** §4 already carries
  `x.get(k) or []` erasing missing/null/empty. This is its sibling one line further on:
  `if not tools or not all(...)` refused an allowlist that was **present and empty**, using the
  argument written for one that was **absent**. The docstring beside it made the distinction
  correctly — "no configuration in which this program is asked to pass everything" is about
  absence — and the code did not, so `tools: []`, a state the schema documents and warns about,
  passed every preflight the harness has and then died at launch with a message about a
  non-empty list. **A validity check whose justification is about a different input than the
  one it rejects is a merged condition.** The two cases are not even close: a missing allowlist
  could become "pass everything", and an empty one is a filter that admits nothing.
- **PROSE CAN CONTRADICT AN INVARIANT THE CODE STATES IN SO MANY WORDS.** §10.10's first draft
  had the proxy perform the HTTP initialization, learn the session id, and hand it to the
  guardian — leaving a network round trip during which a killed proxy takes the only knowledge
  of a live session with it, which is the exact leak the guardian exists to close. The stdio
  half has never worked that way, and says so in a comment on the field: *"The child is the
  GUARDIAN's process, not this one's."* The invariant is **whatever can create a thing that
  outlives this instance is created by the process whose job is to outlive the proxy**, and it
  was already written down, in the file the new design was extending. **When designing an
  extension, re-derive the existing half's invariant from its code rather than from memory of
  what it does** — the failure mode is not forgetting the rule, it is restating it at the level
  of behaviour ("the guardian cleans up") instead of structure ("the guardian owns creation"),
  where the behaviour survives paraphrase and the structure does not (review, PR #108).
- **ONE NOUN COVERING TWO LIFETIMES PRODUCES A FACT THAT CANNOT BE STATED TRUTHFULLY.**
  §10.10's `streams_closed` was written over "every SSE stream this instance opened", which is
  false on the clean path — a POST answered `text/event-stream` closes after its correlated
  response, so most streams are gone long before a teardown. Repairing it to "closed **by the
  teardown**" made it false the other way, saying of a stream that ended an hour earlier that
  the teardown closed it. Both spellings were attempts to describe *two* populations with one
  sentence: request streams, which end on their own, and the standalone channel, which does
  not. The fix is to quantify the fact over **what was still open when the teardown began** —
  and then, because that set can be empty, to record its size, since `done` over an empty
  enumeration and `done` over a broken one are otherwise the same word (§4's `all(...)` rule,
  arriving in a design rather than in code).
  **The second-order damage is the one to watch for**: the same conflation had a `405` to the
  standalone GET licensing a global blank and, worse, "proving" no server-initiated message
  could arrive — which would have retired the filtering of POST stream events, laundering the
  exact traffic §10.6 exists to catch, with a clean audit log (review, PR #108).
- **NAMING A VALUE'S LAST USE READS AS NAMING ITS ONLY USE.** §10.10 said the proxy holds the
  session id "for the ordinary teardown" — true, and the whole of it only if you already know
  the transport requires the id on **every** request after initialization. A bridge built from
  that sentence attaches the header on `DELETE`, passes every check against a fixture that
  issues no session at all, and fails against the first stateful server it meets. The tell is a
  purpose clause on a retained value that mentions one phase of a lifecycle: **say what the
  value is for across its whole life, or say nothing and let the requirement list carry it** —
  a partial purpose is worse than none, because it reads as complete (review, PR #108).
- **"WHICH FIELD IS SECRET" IS THE WRONG AXIS; THE QUESTION IS WHOSE VALUE SPACE IT IS.**
  §10.10 twice put the resolved endpoint in an audit record, and once wrote the rule out loud
  as "endpoint only, never the headers" — a sentence that sounds careful and sorts the fields
  by the wrong property. `${VAR}` is honoured in `url`; `interpolated_refs` lists it beside
  `env` and `headers` for exactly that reason. So `https://host/mcp?token=${TOKEN}` resolves to
  a URL that IS a credential, written to a file the harness reads and can quote into a failure
  message. (The first draft of this entry said "a log archived per cell"; it is not archived —
  see the §10.7 correction. The rule never needed that premise, and reaching for it was the
  same reflex as citing a spec page without checking which revision it was on.)
  **Sort by whether the value
  space is under this harness's control**: the declared server name is safe by construction —
  the schema admits `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` and forbids interpolation — while no subset of a resolved
  URL is, since a secret can sit in the query, the path, the userinfo or a subdomain. "It would
  be scrubbed" is not the answer either: §4 already records that redaction skips values under
  `MIN_REDACTABLE_LEN` and that a short credential is still a credential.
  Applying the same test one field further found a second instance the review had not named —
  the session id, a capability handle for a session still open, was being persisted to answer a
  question the reader never asks. The record keeps the *state*; the **guardian** retains the id,
  because it is the process that must release the session if the proxy dies first, and reports
  it up the **report** pipe for the proxy to hold in memory. (Two drafts said "order pipe" —
  the lifeline carries orders *out* and its EOF fires the sweep, so a report sent that way
  would run against the traffic and take guardian-loss detection with it. Naming a channel by
  what it is *for* rather than by reading the topology is the same slip as the guardian
  ownership round, one file over.) (review, PR #108)
- **"THE PROCESS SURVIVED" IS NOT EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT IT ASKED SOMEONE ELSE TO DO.** §10.10
  inferred "no order to initialize was ever issued" from *a terminator with no connect record*:
  the proxy lived, so it would have written the record had there been anything to write.
  The two events bound different windows. The guardian's identity report comes **before** the
  launch order; the connect record cannot be written until the initialization *result* returns.
  A guardian can authenticate, take the order, mint a session and die in between, leaving a live
  proxy writing a terminator over a session that exists — recorded as `not_applicable`, the one
  answer that is certainly wrong. **An absence is only evidence against an event if the record
  that would have carried it is written BEFORE that event**, which is why §10.5 puts the
  instance boundary ahead of the spawn attempt and why the audit sink flushes on every write.
  The repair is the same move one level down: a `connect_attempt` record, flushed before the
  order goes down the pipe, turning "never ordered" and "ordered, outcome unknown" into two
  recorded states instead of one inference (review, PR #108).
- **A VALUE FROM AN OPEN DOMAIN CANNOT CARRY ITS OWN STATUS IN-BAND.** §10.10's connect record
  held `session: none | <id> | indeterminate`, which is unsound the moment you look at what an
  id may be: visible ASCII, so a real session id may literally *be* `"none"`. A live session
  would then decode as no session and its release would be skipped — the failure landing on the
  one path the whole record exists to protect. The tagged form is `{"state": …, "id": …}` with
  `id` required for `known` and forbidden otherwise, malformed in both directions. This repo had
  already solved the same problem: `_MISSING` exists in `mcp_audit` because `child_status: null`
  is "a record claiming the evidence exists while carrying none of it". **The generalization is
  wider than absence** — any status multiplexed into a field whose value space you do not
  control is a collision waiting for a peer that picks the wrong string (review, PR #108).
- **NARROWING A RULE TOO FAR LEAVES A CASE WITH NO LEGAL SPELLING, AND THE FIX IS THE
  CROSS-PRODUCT.** Told that `connect_failed` must not blank `session_released`, the repair said
  "never" — and the branch where there is *no connect record at all*, because the guardian never
  completed phase one and so never received a launch order, then had no legal fact: nothing was
  minted, nothing can be released, and the only honest state was the one just forbidden. Two
  rounds, two overshoots, in opposite directions, on one predicate. **When a rule is corrected
  by narrowing, enumerate the cross-product of its inputs and give each cell a value** — here
  {no record, none, known, indeterminate} × the fact — rather than editing the sentence that was
  wrong. Enumerating it also produced the premise that makes the first cell sound: the terminator
  must be *present*, since a missing connect record without one is the absence case and may well
  be hiding a session.
- **A PARALLEL COPIED FROM THE OTHER TRANSPORT CARRIED A PREMISE THAT DOES NOT HOLD THERE.**
  `connect_failed` was given `spawn_failed`'s exact shape — trigger ⟺ no record, licensing
  every fact of the phase — because the two occupy the same slot in their respective
  lifecycles. They are not the same in the way that decides this: a failed spawn produces
  **nothing** (no pid, no pgid, nothing to clean up), while a failed connect can already have
  produced **a session**. An initialization that succeeded and was then refused for an
  unsupported negotiated version is a `connect_failed` holding a live session id, and blanking
  `session_released` there says "there was nothing to release" about a thing the run created.
  **When reusing a structure across two implementations of the same abstraction, ask what the
  original's shape was PROVING, not what position it occupied** — `spawn_failed ⟺ no record`
  was true because nothing survives a failed spawn, and that premise is what failed to carry.
  The repair partitions by evidence (`none` / `<id>` / `indeterminate`) and needed a fourth
  fact state, `unknown`, for a residue the prose had been acknowledging for three rounds while
  the grammar had no shape for it — a paragraph admitting a gap the record cannot express is
  its own defect (review, PR #108).
- **AN OBSERVATION WHOSE WINDOW INCLUDES THE SUBJECT'S EXIT CANNOT ATTRIBUTE WHAT IT SEES TO
  THE SUBJECT — the C3-3 lesson, third instance, and this one was already written down.** The
  positive control for §10.10's stream teardown had the fixture witness the closes, which is
  worth nothing on its own: a proxy that records the right identities, closes nothing, writes
  its terminator and exits closes every socket on the way out, and the fixture sees the same
  EOF. It is the same sentence as the entry above about reaping — "a proxy that exits without
  reaping leaves a child that init adopts and reaps, and afterwards the two are identical" —
  with sockets substituted for a child, and the remedy stated there is the one that applies:
  prefer evidence that cannot race the exit, then check the witness's discriminating power.
  Sockets admit no monotone equivalent of the inherited pipe, so the window gets constrained
  instead: observe while the subject is provably alive, behind a test-only gate, **and** add a
  negative control proving the witness can report the other answer. **The general check is to
  ask what the witness would report if the subject did nothing and then died** — if that is the
  same reading, the case is decorative however elaborate it looks (review, PR #108).
- **A RULE THAT READS A LIST AS A SLOT TURNS AN ORDINARY RACE INTO A MALFORMED RECORD.**
  `stream_open_failed` was defined as the trigger that *latches* iff its record reads `failed`.
  But §10.5.1 says outright that the latch decides which trigger stopped forwarding and not
  which triggers count — a `SIGTERM` may latch while the connection fails microseconds later —
  so the biconditional belongs over **membership** in the trigger list. Writing it over the
  latch made a legal ordering illegal.
  Fixing it raised a second question and I answered it from the shape of the rule instead of
  from the code, which is its own lesson. `not_applicable` is licensed by the LATCH, and I
  argued that a signal could latch ahead of a failed spawn, making the check a false anomaly in
  shipped code and requiring the licence to be loosened to list membership. **Reading the path
  says otherwise, and says it structurally.** The signal handler does nothing; `set_wakeup_fd`
  writes a byte drained only by `_on_signal`, which runs only inside `_pump`'s loop; and `run()`
  is `if self._spawn(): … self._pump(…)`, so a failed spawn returns without ever entering the
  loop and the byte is never read. `spawn_failed` is alone in the list every time —
  `_spawn_partition`'s own docstring had said so, and I contradicted it. **A claim that shipped
  code has a race is a claim about control flow, so it has to be traced rather than argued
  from the shape of the predicate**; the general form is the one this file already carries about
  the guardian and about the pipe topology, arriving a third time (review, PR #108).
  The decision that follows is the opposite of the one I proposed: keep the latch key, require
  the bridge to preserve the property by construction, and add the arms nobody had written —
  one on the reader (a `[signal_term, spawn_failed]` record with blanks must be refused) and one
  on the writer (a signal during a failing spawn never reaches the trigger list). Weakening a
  rule to tolerate a state that cannot occur would also have accepted a blank in some future
  arrangement where the phase really had run.
- **A UNIVERSAL WRITTEN TO CLOSE ONE LOOPHOLE CONTRADICTS THE RULE IT WAS CARVED OUT OF.**
  Having established that a server declining a capability must not blank a completion fact, the
  next sentence said `streams_closed` is "never `not_applicable`" — flatly, three paragraphs
  from a list where `connect_failed` licenses exactly that. Both statements were about blanks
  and they meant different things by one: *the capability was never offered* and *the phase was
  never entered* are different facts, and only the second is an ending. The scope that was
  missing is one clause — "after the connect record exists" — and the tell is a claim written
  as an absolute in a document that had just spent a paragraph distinguishing two sources for
  the same word. **When a rule is stated to exclude one case, say which of the existing sources
  it excludes**, or it reads as excluding all of them (review, PR #108).
- **A RECORD WITH THREE DISPOSITIONS NEEDS THREE ENDINGS, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE NOBODY
  WRITES.** The new stream record could read `open`, `unavailable` or `failed`, and every
  instance must latch a terminal trigger — but `failed` had none: it happens after the connect
  record so it is not `connect_failed`, and no stream ever opened so it is not `stream_lost`.
  The enumeration that catches this is mechanical and worth running on any new record: **for
  each value the record may hold, name the trigger that ends the instance, and for each
  trigger, name the record state that implies it.** Both directions, because the one-directional
  version admits a terminator carrying a trigger the record contradicts. It also forced the
  useful question of what the new trigger licenses — nothing, since the connection and session
  still exist, and an ending that skipped the session release because the *stream* failed would
  leak on the strength of an unrelated failure.
- **A FACT OBSERVED AFTER A RECORD IS WRITTEN CANNOT BE IN THAT RECORD.** Obvious stated
  plainly, invisible in prose: the same section had the server→client stream opened *after* the
  connect record and its outcome recorded *in* it. An append-only log is exactly the structure
  that makes this impossible, and it is the structure the whole audit design rests on. **When a
  design says "recorded in X", check that every fact named is available at the moment X is
  written** — the repair is either to move the observation earlier or to give it a record of
  its own with its own absence semantics, and which one is right depends on what the earlier
  record is *for*.
- **AN INSTRUMENT THAT SUPPLIES THE THING IT SHOULD OBSERVE CLEARS EVERY CHECK BUILT ON IT.**
  `Channel.rpc` sets `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` on every request it makes,
  which is right for a helper testing the *fixture* and disqualifying for one meant to witness
  whether a *client* sends it: the bridge could omit the header entirely and every green check
  would stay green. Same family as the probe marker the prompt supplied — a claim and the thing
  it claims about must not have the same author — and it is worth stating separately because
  the giveaway is different. There the instrument generated the value; here it fills in a
  default so ordinary that nobody reads the line. **Before asserting a peer sends X, check
  what the test client does with X when nobody asks it to** (review, PR #108).
- **AN OBSERVER THAT FAILS OPEN CERTIFIES WHATEVER IT CANNOT SEE.** `guardian_pids()` read `ps`
  and returned an empty set on any error, ignoring the return code — so "no guardian survived"
  and "the instrument did not run" were the same answer, and review reproduced a green
  `ALL PASS` with `ps` denied at rc 127. Every reading a check makes *from absence* needs its
  channel to have said something positive first: `ps` that cannot see **this** process has not
  enumerated the machine whatever it exited with, and the survivor claim is now conjoined with
  having watched that same guardian be found while the case held it alive. A verifier cannot be
  a mutation target, so the failure paths are proved by driving them on a scratch copy — the
  three here are `ps` missing, `ps` exiting non-zero, and `ps` answering blind (PR #109).
- **A MUTATION CAN GO STALE WITHOUT ITS ANCHOR GOING STALE, AND ONLY A FULL RUN SEES IT.**
  `F49` perturbed a `missing` list in `remote_shape`. A later round added type checks below it
  that refuse an absent value just as they refuse a wrong one — which made the `missing` clause
  able to change the failure MESSAGE and never the verdict. The mutation stopped producing a
  defect, and reported **MISSED**. Nothing cheap could have caught it: the anchor still matched
  exactly once, so `stale_anchors` was silent; and the entry was not one of the ones that round
  touched, so driving the touched mutations was silent too. **What changed was the code
  UNDERNEATH an untouched entry.** Two lessons. First, when a new check subsumes an older one,
  the older one is now dead code that reads like a defence — delete it, or a reader will believe
  the case is defended where it is not. Second, this is the class of failure that justifies the
  full suite existing at all: cheap preflights catch what *you* broke, and only a complete run
  catches what your change made *harmless somewhere else*.
- **A CHECK THAT ASKS ITS QUESTION WITH THE DEFINITION UNDER TEST CANNOT SEE THAT DEFINITION
  SHRINK.** "Where import is possible, import" is the right rule and it has an edge: the
  control-var leak check imported `CONTROL_ENV`, built the list of names to look for from it,
  and asserted the child saw none of them. Reads perfectly; cannot fail. The mutation that
  removes a name from the tuple removes the *question* about that name in the same stroke, so
  the leaked variable is the one nobody asks about — driven by hand and returned MISSED before
  the suite ever ran it (PR #109). The rule is not "stop importing"; it is that **the query and
  the answer must not come from the same expression**. Ask by a property the members share (a
  prefix, a shape, a directory) so a member leaving the set does not leave the question, and
  pin the case to the declaration with a separate equality check — which is what then catches a
  member being *added* and left unexercised. The tell is a comprehension over the imported
  collection sitting on both sides of the assertion.
- **A PROMISE STATED WIDER THAN THE MECHANISM IS THE §10.6 DEFECT, NOW IN A DESIGN DOC.** The
  bridge was specified for Streamable HTTP and its adapter step described as "stops refusing a
  remote server" — but the schema admits two remote transports, and the deprecated `2024-11-05`
  pair is a different state machine: a GET opens the receiving stream, an `endpoint` event
  supplies a second URL, POSTs are answered `202` and replies arrive on the original stream.
  Nothing about it appeared anywhere in the section. This is the third instance of one family —
  §10.6's tool-definition scan, #107's per-adapter filter constant, and now a scope sentence —
  and the new part is that **it can be committed before any code exists**, where nothing runs
  and no mutation can catch it. The check is mechanical: for each capability the design
  promises, enumerate what the *schema* admits under it, and confirm the specified mechanism
  covers each one or that the design refuses it by name.
- A FIFO fixture on the main thread wedged the whole suite under the mutation that makes the
  scrub read every non-directory. Use a **socket** — same `_give_up` branch, but `open()`
  fails `ENXIO` instead of blocking. The one arm that genuinely needs a FIFO joins a 20s
  thread for exactly this reason.
- An 8-space mutation anchor is a substring of the same call indented 12 spaces elsewhere in
  the file. It matched the wrong site and injected an `IndentationError`, which the runner
  reports as "failed, but NOT via" — not as a defect found. Pin anchors with a leading
  newline, and check the mutant still parses.
- A test's cleanup must not be able to reach further than what it created. A mutation that
  changed `exec_ws` made a fixture's `rmtree(dirname(cwd))` resolve to the **system temp
  dir** and it deleted its own working tree. Fixtures now verify the shape before touching.
- Selftest arms within one section share mutable setup, and a raise aborts the siblings.
  There is a `_try` helper and a per-section crash guard; use them.
- A test helper that walked a **real-home overlay** with `home_write_escapes` was harmless at
  `followlinks=False` but, under the M65 mutation that flips it to `followlinks=True`, walked
  the whole real home at 100% CPU and wedged the suite for tens of minutes. Never feed a
  real-home overlay to a walk a mutation can turn recursive; the fix gated that capture to the
  small contained-home fixtures only. `mutate_mcp.py` now also bounds each selftest with a
  `timeout` (reported as `TIMEOUT`, counted as *uncaught*), so a looping mutation is a finding
  rather than an infinite hang — but it is a backstop, not a licence to hang. Each result line
  carries TWO clocks and the summary names the slowest **by CPU**; read them against the
  `baseline:` line, which carries both for the same reason. A mutation at several times its
  suite's CPU baseline is already the M65 shape, just not yet past the timeout, and that gap is
  the only warning anyone gets before it becomes a hang. Read the CPU figure and not the wall
  one: under `--jobs N` every suite takes longer without any of them being wrong, and the
  loudest wall number names whichever mutation was unluckiest with the scheduler.
- **THE WORST ONE SO FAR: a mutation closed every application on the machine (2026-08-12).**
  `mutate_mcp.py` grew a process-tree sweep for the timeout path. A check called it with no
  parentage root, spelled `-1` — no process has that parent, so it read as a harmless "match
  nothing". Mutation `F98` moved the kill ahead of the enumeration as a bare
  `os.kill(root, SIGKILL)`, and **POSIX defines `kill(-1, …)` as every process the calling user
  may signal**; `kill(0, …)` is the caller's whole process group. Eleven minutes into a full
  run, the mutant executed it. No panic, no crash reports, nothing in the log — SIGKILL leaves
  none of those — just every user process gone while the root-owned ones stayed up, which is
  the signature to recognise it by.

  Three rules come out of it, and the third is the one that generalizes furthest:

  1. **A sentinel must be a value the dangerous call cannot accept.** `None` is right because
     `os.kill(None, …)` raises; `-1` and `0` are wrong because they are *valid and mean
     something enormous*. The marker on the same function had already been moved from `""` to
     `None` for exactly this reason, with a docstring about it — and the root sentinel beside
     it was left as `-1`. Getting the argument right about one parameter is not getting it
     right about the function.
  2. **One place signals, and it validates.** `_signal()` refuses anything that is not a
     positive int. Containment in the callers is not containment.
  3. **A mutation suite runs deliberately broken code by design, so a destructive call is only
     as contained as its WORST REACHABLE VARIANT.** Any mutation touching a kill, a delete or a
     write outside the work tree has to be written *through* the guarded primitive rather than
     around it, so that the mutant is contained too. And the guard itself is not a mutation
     target: a mutation may perturb which processes are chosen, never the check that decides
     whether a chosen thing is a process at all. Establish that one by driving the values.
- **An observation channel needs the SAME treatment wherever it appears, and the second copy
  had none of it.** `verify_mcp_proxy.py` learned in PR #109 that a denied `ps` prints ALL PASS:
  its `process_table()` raises on three modes — missing/denied, non-zero exit, and the
  self-witness (`ps` that cannot see its own caller has not enumerated the machine). Then
  `mutate_mcp.py` grew a SECOND process observer for the timeout sweep with none of them, and a
  reviewer reproduced all three against it (PR #111). Two copies of a rule about trusting an
  instrument is §4's duplicated-rule problem aimed squarely at the place absence is read as
  proof, so there is now ONE observer and the proxy verifier imports it.

  Two further things fell out, and both are the aimed-beside-it shape:

  - **Availability and containment are different failures.** Losing the descendants is a
    containment failure that must be NAMED — an empty leftover with no fault certifies a tree
    nobody enumerated. Losing the ROOT is a hang: before the reap moved into a `finally`, a
    raise out of the sweep left the suite process neither signalled nor waited for, and the
    runner blocked forever on `wait4` with one worker gone and nothing saying why.
  - **A `finally` beside an `except` for the expected failure is exercised by neither.**
    `ObserverFailed` is caught, so the blind-`ps` case reaches the reap through the `except`
    and would with no `finally` at all — the mutation that dedented it came back MISSED. What
    the `finally` buys is every OTHER exit from the sweep, and testing it means injecting one.
    Likewise a failing `ps` that prints NOTHING is answered by the self-witness clause, so the
    exit-status clause goes untested unless the fake `ps` emits a valid row for the caller.
- **A LIVE case proves the mechanism works; only a SCRIPTED one proves a given interleaving is
  handled — and the difference showed up three times in one review round.** The timeout sweep's
  live probes are real: they spawn real descendants, `setsid` and all, and they caught most of
  what was aimed at them. What they could not do is arrange a *specific* ordering on demand:

  - The one-round-freeze mutation needs a child born between the snapshot and its parent's
    `SIGSTOP`. The root has the lowest pid so it is stopped first, within milliseconds, and the
    spawner emitted every 50ms — so the case was hit perhaps one run in fifteen. It came back
    CAUGHT on a targeted drive and MISSED on the full run fifteen minutes later. **A flake in a
    mutation suite is worse than a failure**: every time it passes it certifies coverage that
    is not there. Scripted — a `process_tree` whose second generation appears only on the
    second look — it is 10/10.
  - The report-what-we-froze mutation only matters when a sweep leaves something behind, and
    SIGKILL works, so a survivor is by definition the thing that did not happen. It came back
    MISSED until the leftover computation was pulled out into `survivors()` and driven on a
    table.
  - The three observer failure modes are the same shape: a real `ps` does not fail on request.

  The rule: **if the property is about an ORDER or an ABSENCE, write the case that scripts it.**
  Keep the live one too — it is what proves the scripted one is describing the real mechanism —
  but do not let it be the only evidence, because the run where it passes by luck is
  indistinguishable from the run where it passes for the reason you meant.
- **A TEST DOUBLE THAT CANNOT EXPRESS THE DEFECT IS A CHECK THAT CANNOT FAIL, and it looks
  exactly like a check that passes.** Twice in one review round, on the same function. The
  freeze's scripted machine stopped a process the instant `_signal` was called — so it was
  proving the code correct against a machine where the bug is impossible. Real `os.kill`
  returns when the signal is QUEUED; the target keeps running until the kernel delivers it, and
  a target still running can still fork. A fixed point over pids SIGNALLED is therefore not a
  fixed point over pids STOPPED, and the gap is exactly wide enough for one more child to be
  born, orphaned by the kill that follows, and carry no argv anyone can find it by.

  The fix is to settle on OBSERVED state — `ps` already reports `T`, which this code parsed and
  discarded after the zombie test — and never to conclude on the same snapshot in which it
  signalled. The double now models delivery LAG, and models a process killed while still
  running getting one last child out first.

  **The question to ask of a double is not "does it stand in for the real thing" but "can the
  defect I am testing for occur in it".** A synchronous mock of an asynchronous mechanism
  answers no, silently, forever.
- **"Gone" is not an answer, and a set intersection is where that gets forgotten.** The freeze
  waited for every signalled pid to be observed stopped — by intersecting the signalled set with
  the live process table. A pid that DISAPPEARED therefore dropped out of the wait and read as
  settled. But a process that exits may have forked on the way out, and that child is reparented
  with no link to anything and possibly nothing in its argv to name it. Presence and confirmation
  are different facts: once a pid has been SEEN stopped it is safe to lose, and before that its
  absence is unaccounted for and no amount of looping resolves it. Track them apart.

  The general form, which is the same shape as the trustworthy-predicate rule one level up:
  **an intersection with "what is still there" silently reclassifies everything that left.**
  Before writing one, ask what it means for a member to vanish — if the answer is "we do not
  know", it does not belong on the satisfied side of a fixed point.
- **A registry cleanup reads must be written BEFORE the act, and the cleanup must reach every
  member.** One rule seen from each end, and the sweep got both wrong. `frozen` is the only set
  the `finally` can kill, and it was updated after a whole batch of `SIGSTOP`s — so a failure
  partway through that batch left the pids already stopped unregistered, and therefore unkilled,
  by the very block written to guarantee they would be. The cleanup loop then abandoned the rest
  of the set at its own first failure. Both leave the same wreckage, and it is worse than a leak:
  a stopped process never exits, so the `wait4` the teardown exists to make safe blocks forever.

  The tell for the first half is a `finally` whose reachability argument depends on a variable
  assigned after the thing it protects against. The tell for the second is a bare `for` in a
  teardown. This program had already paid for the second once — the guardian's `sweep()`
  announced itself before signalling, a `BrokenPipeError` from the announcement left a
  credential-bearing group alive (PR #103) — so the rule was already written down and was
  applied only where it had been reproduced. Every teardown loop in the tree is now best-effort
  per member: `_kill_all` in `mutate_mcp.py`, the startup-probe reap in `verify_mcp_fixtures.py`,
  the held-group teardown in `verify_mcp_proxy.py`. The production paths already had it, and
  `exec.py` says why in a comment — which is what "state the rule, not the reproduction" buys.
- **A resource goes back into a pool only if it is known CLEAN, and "the run finished" is not
  that knowledge.** The timeout path already said out loud when its sweep had left a descendant
  alive or could not establish that it hadn't — and the work tree went back into the queue on
  exactly that path, because the `finally` that returns it was written when the only failure it
  could imagine was a worker keeping one. So the next mutation drew a directory with a live
  process executing out of it and the pre-revert code still resident, and every verdict after
  that was a fact about two runs at once. Then `rmtree` deleted the directory from under it,
  which loses what the process was and where it came from while doing nothing about the process.

  Three parts, and each is separately the whole defect: **contamination is a property of the
  ENDING, not of the verdict** (so it travels on the record); **deleting the container is not
  dealing with the tenant** (so a poisoned run keeps its trees and prints where they are, and
  the leftover glob in the block above then reports them, which is correct rather than a
  nuisance); and **the run stops** — there is no reading under which the remaining mutations are
  worth their twelve minutes once a process nobody can account for is running on the machine.
  An exception counts as contamination too: a sweep that RAISED is precisely the case where what
  survived is unknown, so the default has to be the careful one.
- **A rule about a shared resource belongs at the boundary that OWNS it, not in each producer
  that touches it.** "An exception counts as contamination" went into the mutation worker,
  because that is where the reproduction was. A BASELINE that raised then walked straight past
  it: the exception reached the frame holding the tmpdir with the run still unpoisoned, and the
  `finally` deleted every work tree out from under whatever the baseline had left running. Same
  rule, second spawner, one review round later — which is the third time in this PR that a fix
  stopped exactly where its reproduction did.

  **The sharper form of "fix the principle, not the reproduction", and the one that would have
  caught all three: a guard written inside one of N producers has to be REMEMBERED by producer
  N+1.** Written at the boundary — the frame that creates the resource and destroys it — it
  quantifies over every producer there will ever be. Here that is one `try/except BaseException`
  around everything between the `mkdtemp` and the delete, which covers the baseline, the
  workers, `worktree_binds`, and a `KeyboardInterrupt` (the likeliest of the four, and the one
  no per-producer guard would ever have been written for). The tell is a guard whose correctness
  argument mentions a specific caller.
- **A cleanup that suppresses its own errors must not then report success — and its caller must
  ask.** `shutil.rmtree(tmp, ignore_errors=True)` followed by `return True`: a clean run could
  leave every work tree on disk and still exit 0, and the caller dropped the answer anyway, so
  neither half was load-bearing. The flag stays — a teardown that raises partway through is
  worse than one that does what it can — but the claim afterwards now comes from `os.path.exists`.
  This is the errno rule from §10.3 one layer up: **a return value from a call you made is a
  fact about the call, and the question was about the world.** Two tells, and both are cheap to
  grep for: a suppressed-error call adjacent to a success return, and a function returning a
  status nothing reads.
- **Stopping a parallel run is not instantaneous, and the work already in flight is a THIRD
  state.** The pre-draw refusal stops every mutation not yet started; the seven siblings already
  inside their suites finish and used to hand back ordinary verdicts, which were counted and
  printed as results — measured on a machine that by then had an unknown extra tenant competing
  for the cores, ports and fixture servers those suites bind. They are neither "ran" (their
  conditions cannot be stated) nor "did not run" (they did), so they get their own verdict,
  `INCONCLUSIVE`, keep their original line for whoever reads the wreckage, and count towards
  nothing. **A stop condition in a concurrent program needs a disposition for the work that
  overlapped it, not only for the work that follows it** — and the two are told apart by asking
  before the `finally` that sets the flag, so a worker never reads its own poisoning as
  somebody else's.
- **A `pgrep -f` finds itself, and answers about the search rather than the machine.** The
  after-run leftover check reported three stray guardians immediately after a clean run that had
  left none: the pattern appears in the argv of the pipeline doing the searching, which `ps` and
  `pgrep -f` both enumerate. `[.]` in the pattern fixes it — the bracket matches the literal dot
  and makes the pattern text differ from what it matches. This is the probe rule from CLAUDE.md
  arriving one layer lower than usual: the instrument was inside the population it measured, so
  the reading was about the instrument. The direction of the error is the dangerous one, because
  a false POSITIVE here sends the next reader hunting a leak that is not there — and the same
  mistake in the other direction, a filter that excludes too much, would hide a real one.
- **FOUR FINDINGS ACROSS THREE PROBES, ONE DEFECT: an absence read as a result, from an
  instrument whose own participation was never established.** Every finding of the PR #120/#121 review was this,
  wearing a different coat. A `--secret-env-vars` arm that returned the empty string certified
  redaction — the sentinel was missing because nothing ran, not because anything was redacted. A
  `type`-omission arm that received no tool call certified that copilot had rejected the config —
  but the probe starts that fixture itself, so "listening" says nothing about the client, and a
  turn where the model simply never called the tool produces byte-identical receipts. A candidate
  `--disable-mcp-server` spelling whose run produced no stream at all joined the list of
  "spellings that do not work". And a server's status sequence read at its FIRST element reported
  a dead server healthy, in a reader whose own docstring had argued that reading the first event
  would miss exactly that.
  **The generalization is not "add a control".** Three of the four HAD a control; what they
  lacked was a positive fact about *the arm the conclusion is about*. A control proves the
  quantity can be produced — it says nothing about whether the other arm produced it. So the
  repair is: **name the positive fact the reading requires, and get it from somewhere the subject
  does not author.** The fixture's own receipts for the exchange (a different process, and the
  marker never appears there — only its digest). Copilot's own connection status for whether it
  understood a config, since the MCP host decides that before the model acts. A paired arm
  differing in ONE key for whether this machine and this turn can produce the result at all. The
  last status rather than the first, because a transient (`pending`) precedes the answer.
  **And the offline checks had all been green**, because they had been written from the same
  understanding as the code — the arms encoded the probes' false positives rather than their
  answers. An arm that cannot fail on the case the code gets wrong is not coverage; the tell is
  that no arm drives the *distinguishing* case, and here that meant no arm where the treatment
  arm is silent while the control speaks. Each repaired predicate now has an arm that fails
  against the code as it stood, and a mutation aimed at the clause that decides it.
- **FIXING ALL FOUR SITES DID NOT EXHAUST THE PRINCIPLE — a second round found four more, and
  they were the SIBLING defect: an intermediate reading promoted to a conclusion.** Where the
  first round read *absence* as a result, these read a state that had not finished being one:
  a tool call that ARRIVED as one that was answered (the fixture writes its request row before
  it decides whether to reply at all, so a rejected call is byte-identical to a served one); a
  `pending` server status — the transient this same probe had just recorded as preceding
  `connected` — as a terminal failure, along with every word a later build might invent; ONE of
  two expected event sources speaking as the two of them AGREEING; and two contradictory server
  spellings in one run resolved by which the code checked first, which also silently dropped
  the status carried under the loser.
  **The unifying test is worth stating in one line: is the thing you read the quantity you are
  claiming?** Arrival is not completion. A transient is not an outcome. One observation is not
  agreement. A tie is not a winner. Each needed the same repair as round one — a positive fact
  naming the actual quantity — and three of the four needed something that did not exist yet:
  a new fixture row written *after* the reply flushed, a status vocabulary split by what each
  word licenses rather than by equality with the good one, and `EXPECTED_SOURCES` to say what
  agreement is judged against.
  **The lesson for review, not just for code:** the first fix made the four named sites right
  and left the *class* live, because it was stated as "add a witness" rather than as "the
  reading is not the quantity". A repair phrased at the level of the reproduction leaves the
  next instance to be found by the next reviewer — which is CLAUDE.md's first rule, arriving
  in the thing that was supposed to be applying it.
- **A THIRD ROUND FOUND THREE MORE, and two of them were in the CONTROLS the earlier rounds
  had just added.** Strengthening the treatment arm and leaving the control where it was makes
  the pair *less* balanced, not more: the redaction control was still being asked only whether
  the marker appeared SOMEWHERE in its output, while the secret arm had to prove it answered
  the call — and the marker also sits in an env var and in the config the probe writes, on a
  run with `--allow-all`. A control that echoed a config while calling nothing, paired with a
  secret arm whose reply did not render, produced the positive. **A comparison is only a
  comparison if both arms are established to have done the same thing**, so whatever the
  treatment arm must prove, the control must prove too — the third round's rule, and the one
  the second round should have derived.
  The other two are the same shape one level down. A structural clause added to make an
  absence meaningful was itself satisfiable by garbage: "copilot published an inventory and
  ours was not in it" checked only the event TYPE, so `{"data": 42}` — right event, unreadable
  contents — established absence. And question 2's exit predicate checked the server's
  SPELLING while the question also asks for its STATUS, so a witness naming the server with no
  status field answered half a question and exited green. **When you add a clause to make a
  reading meaningful, ask what the WEAKEST input satisfying that clause looks like** — here, an
  event with the right name and no contents, and a predicate with the right shape and one of
  its two terms missing.
- **A FOURTH ROUND FOUND TWO MORE, and both are a reading that stops one field short of the
  quantity.** Round three had just made the redaction CONTROL prove that copilot emitted a
  result carrying the value. The secret arm was still asked only for its **fixture's**
  receipts — and *the receipts end at the wire*. They say the reply went OUT carrying the
  marker; nothing in them says anything came BACK. So an arm with an execution and no
  completion event — killed mid-call, or one whose result copilot never emitted — certified
  `REDACTS` from an output that was never produced, on receipts that were entirely genuine.
  Round three's own rule is symmetric (*whatever the treatment arm must prove, the control
  must prove too*) and it was applied only in the direction the reproduction pointed, which is
  CLAUDE.md's first rule arriving inside the fix for CLAUDE.md's first rule.
  **The boolean was the mechanism.** "Our tool's result carried the value" being `False` meant
  either *it came back without it* or *it never came back at all*, and only the first is
  evidence about redaction. A predicate answering one question with two meanings is the same
  shape §4 already records for one field carrying two independent facts — arriving here as a
  return type rather than a record field. Three states now, and the loss case has a word of
  its own.
  The other finding is the same stopping-short over a different field. `NEVER_STARTS` says
  *copilot did not list our server*, and the code decided it by reading the server's STATUS: an
  entry copilot listed with no `status` gives the status reader `None`, indistinguishable from
  a stream that never mentioned it, while the presence reader confirmed a readable inventory —
  so the pair published "not listed" from the very event that lists it. **A negative about a
  NAME has to be read from the name.** It is its own reading now, tainted by any inventory
  event that could not be parsed and never overturned by one, because an unreadable event
  hides servers and cannot un-name them. That asymmetry is the second half of the lesson:
  when a taint and a positive can both apply to one reading, decide which outranks which
  **deliberately** and write down why — the ordering is the entire content of the rule, and it
  is invisible in code that just happens to check one of them first.
- **A FIFTH ROUND FOUND THE FOURTH ROUND'S OWN FIX ONE FIELD SHORT — and the pattern is now
  the finding.** Round four split "our tool's result came back without the value" from "no
  result came back at all", which was right and stopped exactly where the reproduction did.
  `RESULT_CLEAN` was then assigned to **any** correlated completion, so
  `{"toolCallId": id, "success": false}` — a call that failed, carrying no result at all — read
  as clean, and `REDACTS` was published from a completion with nothing in it. The value was
  absent from a payload that did not exist.
  **Read the ladder, not the rung.** Four rounds walked one witness at a time: does an arm
  exist → did its fixture answer → did copilot emit a completion → does that completion carry a
  result. Each round added the next rung and stopped, and each time the reviewer found the
  gap immediately above it. The generalisable move is to write the chain down *first* — from
  "the value existed" to "a human could have read it in the output" — and ask which links the
  code actually checks, rather than fixing the one the reproduction lands on. A witness added
  to close a gap is itself a new thing that can be absent, malformed, or unsuccessful.
  **Two orderings in this codebase are now deliberate and say so.** `SERVER_NAMED` is read
  before the unreadable-inventory taint, and the leak test is read before the usability test:
  in both, *the reading that accuses outranks the reading that excuses*. Nothing enforces
  either but a comment and an arm, which is why both got a mutation aimed at the ordering
  itself rather than at the clauses either side of it.
  **And `usable_result` fails closed on shape drift** — no `success` field means unreadable,
  not usable — which is only safe because the predicate is pinned to a verbatim 1.0.80 line:
  the refusal shows up as a red §E21 rather than as a probe that quietly stops answering.
- **A SIXTH ROUND FOUND THE TWO WITNESSES JOINED BY NOTHING BUT BEING IN THE SAME RUN.** The
  fixture's `served` row proves a reply went out carrying the marker; copilot's
  `tool.execution_complete` proves a result came back. Five rounds hardened each of those
  separately and never asked what connects them — and nothing does: `toolCallId` is copilot's,
  the JSON-RPC id is the transport's, and no field spans the two. In a run where the model
  called the tool twice, which is what a retry after an error looks like, the reply the
  receipts prove and the result copilot emitted could be different calls, and `REDACTS` was
  published off the pair.
  **Two independent witnesses of one event are not thereby witnesses of the SAME event.**
  That is the generalisation, and it is not the same as any of the five before it: those were
  each about one witness being weaker than its claim. This one is about the JOIN. When a
  conclusion needs two facts from two authors, write down what makes them facts about the same
  occurrence — and if the answer is "they are both in this run", the conclusion is only as
  strong as the run containing exactly one occurrence.
  **Cardinality is a legitimate join when no identifier exists.** One marker-bearing reply, one
  execution, one completion: in that run the completion cannot belong to anything else, and it
  needs no field the protocol does not have. It costs the multi-call run, which is now
  `RESULT_UNATTRIBUTED` rather than measured wrongly — and the alternative that would keep it
  (a per-call nonce minted by the fixture, carried in the reply, recorded on the row) is
  written down in the probe rather than left for the next reader to re-derive, because it
  changes a reply format four probes read and that trade deserves to be visible.
- **A COUNT OF IDENTIFIERS IS NOT A COUNT OF EVENTS, and the cardinality proof rested on the
  wrong one.** The attribution rule above needs "the model called our tool exactly once", and
  it asked `len(mcp_call_ids(events)) == 1`. That function returns a SET and skips any start
  whose `toolCallId` is missing or malformed — both correct for its own question, which is
  what can be correlated on, and both wrong for counting calls. Two starts sharing an id, and
  a usable start beside an id-less one, are two executions the id count reports as one, so
  `RESULT_CLEAN` was published for exactly the ambiguity the clause had just been added to
  refuse. The arm missed it by using two DISTINCT valid ids — the one multi-execution shape
  the id count does catch.
  **And a filtered reader is a partial one.** The repair counted OUR start events, which
  answers "how many times did the model call our tool" and still says nothing about who else
  claims the ids those starts carry. A foreign execution reusing the id makes the completion —
  which names no tool — answer to both, and the classifier read it as ours. Ownership is a fact
  about the WHOLE stream, so `id_claims` counts every start's claim and `mcp_call_ids` returns
  only ids with exactly one owner. **When a reader narrows its population to "ours", ask what
  the discarded rows could have said about the ones kept**: here they were the only evidence
  that the correlation key was a key at all.
  **A deduplicating reader is a lossy counter, and the loss is invisible at the call site.**
  `set`, `dict` keys, `{...}` comprehensions, "skip the malformed ones" — every one of them
  answers a question about *distinct usable* things, and every one is a plausible-looking
  stand-in for *how many happened*. When a proof turns on a count, count the events; derive
  the identifiers separately, and say in both docstrings which question each answers. Here
  that meant `mcp_starts` (a LIST, because the duplicates are the finding) with
  `mcp_call_ids` defined over it, and `is_our_execution` extracted so the two readers cannot
  drift on what "ours" means.
- **A NEW GATE MAKES AN OLDER MUTATION'S ARM INSENSITIVE, AND THE COUNT STAYS GREEN WHILE IT
  HAPPENS.** It has happened in most rounds since the gates started stacking — `F189`, `F190`,
  `F235`, `F238` — and never because a rule weakened. A gate added LATER refuses the same input
  first, so the run still exits 1 and the mutation still "fails", just never through the
  assertion that encodes its rule. `mutate_mcp.py` reporting `failed, but NOT via …` is the
  only reason any of them was noticed; a suite that merely counted failures would have shown a
  full house every time. **Expect it in any round that adds a gate upstream of an existing
  one**, and re-read the older mutations' arms rather than assuming the total covers them.
  **Two repairs, depending on what the rule is about.** When the rule concerns *what a call
  receives* — every launched arm, that arm's own receipts — assert the ARGUMENT, not the exit
  status: an assertion on what comes out is only accidentally sensitive, and the accident
  expires the next time the code gets stricter. When the rule concerns one clause of a
  conjunction, find the input that the OTHER clauses accept and only this one refuses; that
  input changes as the conjunction grows, which is why `F235` and `F238` each moved to a new
  arm rather than to a new rule.
- **A MUTATION THAT CRASHES IS NOT A MUTATION THAT FAILS.** `F222`'s replacement read
  `done[-1]` where the original folded over the whole list, and on the arms where nothing came
  back that is an `IndexError` — which ENDS the linear verifier before the arm named for the
  mutation ever runs. The suite duly reported it red, `failed, but NOT via …`, having been
  caught by two checks in an unrelated section that happen to run earlier. A mutation has to be
  a **plausible wrong implementation**: the version a reasonable person would have written by
  mistake, which for a fold-over-a-list is a last-write-wins scan that still handles the empty
  case. Guard the replacement so it is total, or the mutation tests nothing but the file's line
  ordering.
- **A MUTATION AIMED BESIDE ITS CLAUSE SURVIVES, AND THE SECOND ONE IN A ROUND IS THE TELL.**
  `F228` deleted the `success` test in `usable_result` and nothing went red: every arm named
  for it fed input the OTHER clause rejects anyway — `{"success": false}` carries no payload,
  so the payload test refuses it with or without the mutation. The distinguishing input is a
  **well-formed payload on a failed call**, which no arm had. This is the identical mistake
  `F213`/`F214` made one round earlier over the same kind of two-clause predicate, found the
  identical way: by driving each mutation individually before spending a suite run. When a
  predicate has two guards, the arm for each must feed input the OTHER guard accepts — and
  the cheap way to know is to state, for each guard, the input that only it rejects.
- **A THROWAWAY MUTATION HARNESS IS STILL A HARNESS, and mine left the tree mutated twice.**
  Driving one mutation at a time before spending a full suite run is the right move and it
  costs a script that WRITES SOURCE FILES. The first incident was the plain one — killed
  mid-iteration, three mutations left applied, which then made the verifier's own
  mutate-plumbing section fail *and leave another one applied*, a feedback loop that reads as
  files changing underneath you. The script now refuses to snapshot a tree that is not clean,
  restores on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, and asserts every target byte-identical before it exits.
  The second incident is the one worth recording, because none of that helped: **the tool
  running the script returned while the script was still running.** Its output was
  block-buffered into a pipe, so it looked like a command that had produced nothing and
  finished; it was an orphan (`ppid 1`) still cycling apply/restore, and three successive
  inspections of the same file each caught a different mutation applied. Two follow-up
  "reverts" were then aimed at whatever was applied at that instant. The rule: **`ps` decides
  whether something finished, not the absence of output** — and a tool that writes source
  files gets a run whose completion is observed, not inferred. `git diff --stat` after every
  such run is the cheap version of the same check.
- **A single-line anchor aimed at `mutate_mcp.py` itself matches TWICE**, and one of the two is
  the mutation entry quoting it. It is refused up front by `stale_anchors` rather than silently
  mutating the list instead of the code, but the fix is not obvious from the message: pin it
  with a leading `\n`, which is a real newline in the source and an escape sequence in the
  entry, so the entry cannot match itself. Every `F*` aimed at `SELF` is written that way or
  spans several lines, which has the same effect for the same reason.
- **A VERDICT MAY MERGE STATES; THE SENTENCE BESIDE IT MAY NOT — and an arm that reads the
  verdict cannot see that.** `secret_verdict` publishes a word and a reason, and the reason is
  a second assertion about what was observed. Three of its sentences described what became of
  our tool's result, and each enumerated the five-word vocabulary inline; two of them ended in
  an `else` that named one SPECIFIC observation, so every state reaching that `else` was told
  what a different state would have shown — a leak from an arm with no completion at all was
  told "our tool's result came back without it", and so was a control whose results could not
  be attributed (review, PR #120, ninth round). Every one of those runs got the RIGHT verdict,
  which is why a dozen arms asserting the verdict were green throughout: **a diagnosis is only
  under test if something drives the diagnosis.** The tell is a trailing `else` inside a reason
  string over a vocabulary of more than two words — it is the `elif`-chain rule one level down,
  where the output is prose instead of a verdict. The fix is the same shape as
  `INSPECTABLE_RESULTS`: one table beside the vocabulary, total over it by a check that reads
  the vocabulary OFF THE MODULE rather than restating it, and each sentence asking it for the
  middle. A sixth state is then right in all three sentences at once, and the fallback names
  the state instead of handing it a fifth state's words.
- **EXISTENCE IS SETTLED BEFORE AMBIGUITY, and they are not degrees of one scale.** *Nothing
  came back* is a fact about the stream; *nobody can say whose it was* is a fact about a
  correspondence between two things, and the second question does not arise until both sides
  of it exist. `tool_result_state` read its cardinality gate first, so a run with two starts
  and no `tool.execution_complete` at all answered `RESULT_UNATTRIBUTED` — and published the
  sentence that state carries, which says results came back, about a stream containing none
  (review, PR #120, tenth round). The tell is a gate that COMPARES COUNTS standing ahead of
  the gate that asks whether the thing being counted exists; §4 already had the shape of it —
  two facts from different phases of one lifecycle sharing a field — and this is the phase
  version rather than the field version. The dual is one gate lower and worth the same
  attention: an empty filtered view has two causes, *everything in it belonged to somebody
  else* and *nothing in it could be read*, and only the first is an observation about our tool.
  Excluding a completion needs an id to exclude it by.
- **A CHECK THAT SUPPLIES A CLASSIFIER'S OUTPUT CANNOT SEE IT PRODUCING THE WRONG OUTPUT.**
  The previous round's account arms feed a `RESULT_*` state straight into `result_account()`
  and assert the wording. They prove the table consistent for a supplied state, and they were
  all green while the classifier handed that table the wrong state for four different streams
  — the defect above was invisible to eleven new arms written the round before. Anything with
  a pipeline needs at least one arm per output that runs the WHOLE path, stream to published
  sentence, and the invariants over it must be read back FROM the streams rather than from the
  expectation column beside them: an expectation that agrees with a broken classifier is the
  thing being guarded against. `_seen` in §E21 is that re-read, and the two invariants over it
  ("no completion event means ABSENT", "ABSENT with completions means every one was
  excludable") are the two facts that were false, stated so they can fail.
- **A STATE IS NOT ITS CAUSE, and moving an enumeration into a table does not make it true.**
  `RESULT_UNATTRIBUTED` is reached four ways — two executions, an id missing or shared, no
  marker-bearing reply at all, more than one completion — and its sentence named two of them.
  It was already false for the third the round it was written, and the fourth made it false
  again the moment a new route reached it. The round before had moved that enumeration out of
  an `if/else` and into `RESULT_ACCOUNTS`, which fixed the branch and carried the enumeration
  along with it: the table is keyed on the STATE, so its sentence may say only what is true of
  every run that reaches that state. The same obligation binds the FIXED half of a sentence,
  which is read for several states at once — "so nothing came back to be redacted" was false
  for the one of its three states where something did.
- **A BRANCH THAT BORROWS ITS PREMISE FROM THE GATE ABOVE IT BELONGS ABOVE THAT GATE TOO.**
  The empty-correlated-view branch said, in its own comment, "our id is unique and usable here
  (the gate above)" — and that borrowing is what pinned it below the cardinality gate, where a
  run with two perfectly identifiable executions and one foreign completion was refused as
  ambiguous instead of answered as empty (review, PR #120, eleventh round). A borrowed premise
  makes a decision positionally dependent on something that is not about it: cardinality asks
  which reply a result BELONGS to, and that question needs a result. Write down what the branch
  actually needs — here, every completion carries an id of its own AND every execution of ours
  does, `len(ids) == len(starts)` — and it can then stand wherever it is true. **The tell is a
  comment inside a branch that justifies the branch by pointing at an earlier one.** It is the
  same fix as the round before, one join further in, which is why it was not caught by it: the
  raw existence question moved and the correlated one was left behind.
- **A FACT TWO FIELDS BOTH NAME IS WITNESSED TWICE, AND EITHER-ONE-MATCHING IS NOT
  ATTRIBUTION.** `attributed_to_plugin` read `source == "plugin" and (sourcePlugin == US or
  pluginName == US)`, so an entry naming our plugin in one field and a DIFFERENT plugin in the
  other was ours — and `control_ok` gates the whole probe on that predicate, so an internally
  contradictory witness could carry the headline `REACHES` (review, PR #121). This is §4's
  first assertion trap — a mixed `and`/`or` where the `or` is the interesting term — appearing
  in **production** rather than in a check, and the remedy is the same one `sources_verdict`
  applies to the events probe's two name sources one file over: a fact either of two
  disagreeing witnesses can establish is established by neither. It fails closed on
  disagreement AND on omission, because the build being measured carries both fields, so an
  entry with only one is a shape nobody has observed.
- **AN ARM THAT VARIES BOTH WITNESSES TOGETHER CANNOT SEE WHICH ONE IS CONSULTED.** The arm
  that was supposed to cover this set BOTH plugin fields to `"someone-else"`, so it stayed red
  whichever field the predicate read and an `or` across them was invisible to it. That is the
  one-variable rule (F181, same file) one level up: not "vary one clause of the predicate" but
  **"vary one witness of the conjunction"**, and a conjunction over N fields needs N
  disagreement arms and N omission arms. Generate them from the field tuple rather than listing
  them, so a field added later cannot arrive without its own, and pin the tuple — emptied, an
  `all()` over it is true of every entry.
- **MAKING A SHARED PREDICATE STRICTER CAN BREAK A NEIGHBOURING ARM'S ONE-VARIABLE PROPERTY.**
  `control_ok`'s status arm drove an entry carrying `sourcePlugin` and no `pluginName` —
  attribution enough under the old `or`. Requiring both made that entry fail for TWO reasons at
  once, so `F182`, which disables the status gate, would have stopped moving it: a green arm
  covering nothing. Nothing about `F182` or the status gate changed. **Tightening a predicate
  is a reason to re-read every arm that builds an input for it**, because inputs written to
  pass the old, looser rule now fail the new one incidentally. Same family as a newer gate
  blinding an older arm, with the cause on the data side rather than the control-flow side.
- **MOVING A DECISION CAN LEAVE A CLAUSE BEHIND THAT CAN NO LONGER FAIL, and the mutation
  suite is the only thing that says so.** Hoisting the empty-correlated-view branch above the
  cardinality gate made that gate's `len(ids) != 1` term undecidable: the line is now reached
  only with a non-empty `done`, which needs a completion carrying one of `ids`, so
  `len(ids) >= 1`; and `mcp_call_ids` adds at most one id per start, so the `len(starts) == 1`
  in the same condition bounds it at 1. `F235` — which deletes that term — therefore produced
  code identical in behaviour to the original and **survived**, the fourth time a newer gate
  has made an older mutation's arm insensitive and the first time the cause was the arm's
  clause becoming a tautology rather than an earlier gate answering first. A term that cannot
  fail is worse than an absent one: it reads as a check, is not one, and no mutation of it can
  be caught. The term is gone; the fact it carried moved to `len(ids) == len(starts)` in the
  branch above, where it still bites, and `F257` is the mutation that says so. **`F235`'s ARM
  is untouched and still red** — retiring the mutation is not retiring the coverage, and the
  gap in the numbering carries a comment saying which mutation took it over, so it cannot be
  read later as a deletion.
- **A ONE-WAY INVARIANT IS SATISFIED BY A CLASSIFIER THAT NEVER PRODUCES THE STATE.** "Every
  `RESULT_ABSENT` run had all its completions excludable" was green — and would stay green if
  nothing were ever `ABSENT`. The claim that gives a state meaning is the **iff**, with a
  witness on each side: at least one run that is `ABSENT` with completions, and at least one
  that is not. Both `any(...)` clauses are there for that, and they are the same structural
  clause §4 demands ahead of any `all(...)`, applied to an equivalence rather than to a
  quantifier.
- **THE CROSS-PRODUCT OF TWO TESTED CASES IS A THIRD CASE.** The table drove *several
  executions with no completion* and *one execution with a foreign completion*, and neither is
  *several executions with a foreign completion* — which is the one that was wrong. A table
  built by listing the ways each state is reached will miss the combinations; the invariant
  over the table is what covers them, and only if it is stated as an equivalence.
- **WHERE THE RULE ITSELF IS UNDER TEST, IMPORTING IT IS THE BUG AND DUPLICATING IT IS THE
  FIX — which is the opposite of the standing advice, and the mutation suite is what tells the
  two apart.** §4 says a check that re-derives a definition cannot disagree with it, so import
  where import is possible. The exception is a check whose SUBJECT is that definition: the new
  invariant "a run is ABSENT only when every completion could be excluded" asked
  `EV.completion_id` whether each completion carried a usable id — the very function `F255`
  perturbs — so the mutation and the check moved together and the arm stayed green while the
  classifier misread a numeric id as usable. The fix is the `fixtures/` pattern applied inside
  the verifier: state the rule locally, and pin the copy to the original with an arm over the
  cases that distinguish them. The tell is a check that would still pass if the function it
  names returned anything self-consistent.
- **Re-anchor a mutation whose clause you rewrote; do not retire it.** Extracting that table
  broke three older mutations (`F226`, `F227`, `F232`) whose anchors quoted the enumerations it
  replaced — and what each of them says, "every state in this branch reads alike", is exactly
  what the table now exists to prevent. `stale_anchors` refused the run and named all three
  before a suite was spent, which is the second time that gate has paid for itself in a round
  where a refactor moved code an old mutation was aimed at. The replacement text is usually
  simpler than the original: the same `+ ""`, one call further in.
- **A HEADING IS A UNIVERSALLY QUANTIFIED CLAIM, AND FILING A BULLET UNDER IT ASSERTS THAT
  CLAIM OF THE BULLET.** The section that fixed a status kept in two files opened with
  "Nothing in this section is a task" and then contained, six bullets later, "Worth a sweep
  for others of the same shape". Each bullet had been classified on its SUBJECT — is this
  lesson's work done? — and every falsifier was somewhere else: in a last sentence, an aside,
  a parenthesis. A prose `all(...)` needs what §4 already demands of the code kind: read the
  members, not the label. The fix was to ANSWER the sweep rather than re-file it, which is
  usually the cheaper of the two — its population was `_SCENARIO_OVERRIDE_KEYS`, four keys.
  Two further corrections came back on the answer, and they are the general lesson, not
  the local one: **a negative result carries the scope of the population actually
  enumerated**, so naming those four "the only knobs a YAML file can move" turned a valid
  negative into an overclaim over `env:`, `mcp_servers:`, targets and timeouts, which were
  never looked at; and **a summary must not upgrade the strength of what it summarizes** —
  the paragraph said refused HERE, warned THERE, printed on the plan line, and the sentence
  above it flattened all three into "guarded by check". The property that actually holds
  over all four is the weakest one, which is also the one the defect was about: none is
  taken silently. A leftover intention small enough to restate in a lesson is often small
  enough to settle instead — but the settling gets the same reading the code gets.

---

## 5. Suggested order

1. **Settle materialize vs allowlist.** Everything else depends on it.
2. Build the contained HOME for **one** adapter (claude — it is the only one with Phase 1 MCP
   delivery working end to end, verified live on 2.1.113). Prove `home_write_escapes()`
   returns `[]` for it and that the refusal lifts without touching the refusal.
3. Live-run `scenarios/mcp_echo_cred.yaml` (the credential variant of `mcp_echo_smoke.yaml` —
   `mcp_echo_smoke` itself interpolates no `${VAR}` and takes the plain overlay) and confirm
   the token is in no artifact and no real-home file. **[done for claude — §0]**
4. Only then generalize the adapter contract. **[the contract exists; the next adapter is the
   generalization test — its surface is almost certainly non-empty, unlike claude's.]**

**Do this next, and do it before more adapters:** the refusal lives in `_run_cell_body` and is
adapter-independent, so Phase 1b/2/3 credential runs are all gated behind this. Containment
also subsumes per-cell `$CODEX_HOME` materialization, which is already on the list as codex's
ABA fix and its route to `parallel_safe_config = True`.

## 6. Then, in order

- ~~**codex cannot run a cell at all — fix the trust gate first.**~~ **Done (2026-07-27)** —
  `--skip-git-repo-check` on the cell and probe argv; see §0b for the reasoning and for why
  it is the flag rather than `git init`.
- **Land the parked CI workflow — it is what stops §4 depending on somebody remembering it.**
  `harness/ci-selftest-mutation` (`3f38219`, 2026-07-25) has never run. It was parked because
  the mutation suite took ~80 minutes, and PR #111 is what unblocks it. Do not merge it as
  written; four things are wrong with it, and the first is the one that matters.

  **It could report success over a failing suite.** The mutation step is
  `python3 -u harness/tools/mutate_mcp.py | tee mutate.out`, and a `run:` block with no
  explicit `shell:` gets GitHub's default `bash -e`, which does **not** set `pipefail`. The
  pipeline's status is `tee`'s, so a run reporting MISSED would exit non-zero into a pipe and
  the job would go green. This is the §4 trustworthy-predicate rule arriving in YAML: the exit
  status and the output are two readers of one fact, and here the reader that gates the build
  is looking at the wrong process. Fix it with `set -o pipefail` in the step, an explicit
  `shell: bash` (which sets `-eo pipefail`), or redirect and `cat` afterwards rather than pipe.
  **Whichever is chosen, prove it fails**: point the step at a deliberately broken run once and
  watch the job go red, because a gate nobody has seen fail is a gate nobody has tested.

  **It would never have got that far anyway.** `timeout-minutes: 60` against a suite that took
  ~80 serial: the nightly job would have been cancelled every night. With `--jobs` this becomes
  workable, but N is not copyable from §4 — GitHub's macOS runners have a fraction of the cores
  of the machine that block was measured on (3 at time of writing, against 8 performance cores
  locally). Measure N and the timeout on the runner; do not port the numbers.

  **Its comment is already false.** "dev install (mutate_mcp copies harness/.venv into each work
  tree)" — since #111 the venv is SHARED by symlink, which is what took a work tree from 520MB
  to 11MB. The reasoning for why that is safe is in `make_worktree`.

  **It runs less than half of §4.** Present: the selftest, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, the
  mutation suite. Absent: `make -C harness lint`, `verify_mcp_fixtures.py`,
  `verify_mcp_proxy.py` — which between them hold most of the checks in that block — and the
  after-run leftover checks, which did not exist when the workflow was written. A CI that runs
  the mutation suite but not the two verifiers is running the instrument without the things that
  prove the instrument.
- **Map the FILE-based contained surfaces on Linux — but not before the selftest passes
  there, and not before someone actually needs it.** Deliberately not scheduled; the trigger
  is a real Linux cell run or Linux CI, not tidiness.

  Scope it correctly, because the first version of this entry (and the summary that produced
  it) got it wrong in the alarming direction. What is macOS-specific is **not** the surfaces
  and **not** the machinery: `isolation.py`'s containment path has no platform branch at all
  (the one `darwin` mention is a comment about `normcase`), and the `[]` + environment-token
  route is platform-independent by construction — the token comes from the environment, never
  from HOME, so the keychain never enters into it. A Linux operator who exports `GH_TOKEN` or
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` gets a working contained run today.

  What is macOS-specific is the *negative* half of the claim: "the keychain is unreachable, so
  `[]` is the only answer." On Linux there is probably a credential FILE under HOME that would
  let a contained run work with no environment token at all, and it is unmapped. antigravity's
  `None` may be wrong in the same direction and in its favour — it is refused today because
  macOS gives it no route, and a Linux build storing a file would make it mappable. So the
  declarations are **correct but incomplete** on Linux, not wrong, and the missing piece buys
  convenience rather than safety.

  **The ordering is the part worth writing down: the selftest must be Linux-clean FIRST.** The
  suite is what proves the containment machinery is sound on a platform, and it is not clean
  there — a Linux run fails a symlink-scrub arm that passes on macOS, because several
  filesystem arms encode darwin semantics (xattrs on symlinks, hardlinked symlinks). Probing
  first would produce surfaces validated by a suite that does not pass, which is a measurement
  nobody can trust. Sequence: make the selftest Linux-clean → then `probe_contained_home.py
  --bisect` per adapter (~7 runs each; `--self-check` needs no logins, so it works on a bare
  CI box) → then decide whether the field needs to be platform-conditional. Write no
  `if sys.platform` before that last step: ahead of the measurement it is just a second guess.

  That Linux selftest failure is also why the parked CI workflow
  (`harness/ci-selftest-mutation`) runs on macOS runners rather than Linux, and it is the
  reason to fix, not a reason to switch platforms.
- **Phase 1b codex** — `-c` mapping + canonical `mcp__server__tool` naming in its parser.
  Blocked on §9 probe #2 (whether TOML array/inline-table values survive `-c`). Pairs with
  `$CODEX_HOME` materialization, above.
- **Phase 2 copilot** — `--additional-mcp-config @file`, per-server `tools`, `--secret-env-vars`, plus the
  `type` discriminator the config probe turned up (`local`/`http`/`sse`). **Unblocked 2026-08-12 and
  now the shortest route to the motivating use case**: copilot's `tools:` is measured a hard filter on
  stdio, `http` and `sse` at 1.0.79, with the declared bearer arriving intact, so §8's remote pattern
  needs no proxy and no transport bridge on this adapter — only injection. See `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md`
  §9 probe #3 and §2. The bridge stays required for claude and for agy.
- **Phase 3 antigravity** — MCP injection.
- **C3 harness-owned filtering proxy** — required before any scenario points `tools:` at a
  server its author does not control, and required for agy tool gating regardless.
  **Designed in `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §10 (2026-07-29); built and shipped for stdio
  (#107).** The first cut is stdio only — remote `tools:` stays refused, and since #107 by a
  per-server check that names the transport rather than by the blanket refusal that had been
  covering it incidentally. **The transport bridge that lifts it is designed in §10.10
  (2026-08-11)**, and for `transport: http` only — `sse` + `tools:` stays refused by name,
  because the `2024-11-05` pair is a second state machine rather than an option on this one.
  The decision layer is reused verbatim; the ending model forks per transport (`FACTS_REMOTE`,
  `connect_failed`, a connect record, a session to release instead of a group to signal); and
  the guardian generalizes rather than disappearing — **it owns the request that mints the
  session**, exactly as it already owns the spawn, because a proxy that learned the session id
  and then handed it over leaves a window with the shape of the leak the guardian exists to
  close. The standalone server→client `GET` stream is in the first cut with a lifecycle of its
  own, because the proxy presents *stdio* to the CLI and stdio is symmetric: not opening it
  would turn a bidirectional channel into a half-duplex one with nothing able to notice. Probe **C3-4** decides whether a session the server declines to terminate is clean,
  and asks first whether that server is even in the era this machinery belongs to — modern
  removed protocol sessions. **Both are now answered (2026-08-14) against a real remote server,
  though not the SlideRule one**: legacy `2025-11-25`, a session issued, and 5 of 5 released on
  request, so §10.10's "a retained session is not clean" is not an outage against a conformant
  server. Build order: ~~probe **C3-0**~~ →
  ~~probe **C3-1**~~ → ~~a **dual-era mode for `fixtures/echo_mcp_server.py`** (#98)~~ →
  ~~the **decision layer** + its arms, wired to nothing (#100)~~ →
  ~~the **audit record types**, the structural validator and `verdict()`
  (`agentskill_evals/mcp_audit.py`), written before the code that produces them~~ →
  ~~the **I/O half** (spawn, the two pumps, `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handlers, §10.5's shutdown,
  writing the audit log) plus a wire-level driver (#103)~~ →
  ~~the **adapter integration** that unlocks `tools:` for stdio (#107)~~ → **the bridge**,
  in §10.10's slices, of which the **zeroth is a stdio fix that owes nothing to the bridge**:
  `mcp_audit` licenses `not_applicable` off the LATCH, so a signal racing a failed spawn
  already reports a false `not_applicable_unlicensed` today. Then the ending model on
  synthetic records, then a **session arm for
  `fixtures/http_mcp_server.py`** (which implements none today, and everything downstream of
  `session_released` needs one), then the HTTP client half, then the guardian's session
  release with its kill inside the minting window, then the adapter branch.
  Everything before an adapter slice cannot affect any run, which is the point: this is
  harness code in the request path of every gated cell.
  **The I/O half starts from §10.5.1, written before its code**: every way an instance can end,
  on two axes — the triggers, latched in order, plus the cleanup outcomes accumulated after
  them — together with a positive completion fact per teardown step, since a list of things
  that went wrong is silent about a step that never ran at all. The verdict is a monotonic
  conjunction over all of it rather than a lookup on whatever happened last, behind a
  structural clause, since every other clause is universally quantified and an empty record
  satisfies them all.
  One total `is_clean` that every consumer reads (terminator record, per-instance verdict,
  `verify_post_run`), no default-clean branch, and phase carried in the reason rather than in a
  flag each caller applies, which dissolves the "`EPIPE` is clean in exactly one place"
  conditional into distinct reasons. Endings that no enumeration can reach — `SIGKILL`, a crash
  after the start record, a truncated terminator — are covered by one absence rule and are
  tested separately, because totality over the enum cannot see them. That enumeration exists up
  front because this is the defect shape §4 has already paid for twice on #100; the single-axis
  first draft reproduced it *in the section written to prevent it* (review, #101), which is the
  cheapest possible demonstration that it needed writing down.
  **Probe C3-2 resolved 2026-07-31** (`tools/probe_mcp_pipelining.py`): no CLI pipelines
  requests behind `initialize`, which is what licenses §10.2 REFUSING one. A pending
  negotiation cannot govern traffic — the pipelined request's response may arrive first,
  under no version at all — so tolerating pipelining needs a defer-and-replay action, and
  C3-2 says the refusal costs the fleet nothing today. It needed a new
  shim mode (`PROBE_MCP_INIT_DELAY_MS`) *and* a raw-fd read path in the shim, because
  `sys.stdin.readline()` buffers a chunk rather than a line and would have hidden exactly the
  bytes being measured. claude was free to probe at 2.1.113 (`claude mcp list` health-checks
  stdio servers with a full handshake); the other three cost one cheap model call each.
  **That stopped being true at 2.1.231**: `claude mcp list` takes no options there, so the
  global `--mcp-config`/`--strict-mcp-config` do not scope it and it health-checks the USER's
  servers instead of the supplied one; the `.mcp.json` route needs an interactive approval.
  All four now cost a call. A procedure is version-qualified exactly as a reading is, and
  nothing reports its decay except trying to use it (`DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §9).

  **Both gating probes resolved 2026-07-29** (`fixtures/probe_era_mcp_server.py`, results in
  `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §9). Three findings changed the build:
  1. **The fleet is split three ways.** claude and copilot `2025-11-25`, codex
     `2025-06-18`, agy **`2026-07-28`** (modern). Dual-era is a day-one requirement, and
     "legacy" is two implementations rather than one. The version allowlist is those
     three exactly.
  2. **The proxy MUST handle `SIGTERM`.** codex and copilot signal rather than closing
     stdin; without handlers that write the terminator, §10.5's verdict rule fails every
     clean cell on half the fleet.
  3. **`subscriptions/listen` exists and agy uses it.** A request that is never answered
     is normal, so the in-flight correlation map must not treat one as a leak or a
     timeout.
  The fixture step moved ahead of the proxy because agy being modern makes it a
  prerequisite rather than a contingency.

Smaller, unblocked:

- ~~Report the **witnessed** MCP server set from the init event so MCP matrices can reach
  `verified`.~~ **Done (2026-07-28)** — `ParseOutput.mcp_servers_witnessed` carries
  `(name, status)` pairs from claude's init event along the path `cli_version` already takes,
  and `_consistency` prefers it over argv. The set and the health are **two axes**, because
  the first cut folded them together and manufactured both states it exists to prevent
  (unstated health reading as agreement, and as drift). The third state is what makes the
  split work and it is a property of the source: a witness that omits a status leaves health
  *unknown*, while argv names servers it **disabled**, which never ran and so have no health
  to state. See `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §8 Phase 1.
- Portable `used_mcp_tool` assertion (§7) once a second adapter lands.
- ~~Refuse `isolated: false` combined with `mcp_servers:`.~~ **Done (2026-07-28)**, narrowed
  from the flat phrasing: the refusal is a property of where the adapter's **kill-switch
  lives**, not of isolation. copilot and agy keep MCP off with masks in the overlay, so a
  cell with no isolated HOME loads the user's real servers beside the declared ones and is
  refused; claude (`--strict-mcp-config`) and codex (per-server disables) hold whatever HOME
  the child is handed, and a blanket rule would have refused the one configuration that
  works today for no safety gain. Classified by a declared **tri-state**
  (`mcp_off_mechanism`: `CLI`, `OVERLAY_MASKS`, or `None` for not-determined). Deriving it
  from mask presence answered "has a mask" rather than "depends on one"; a boolean then made
  *unclassified* share a value with *uses masks*, so an adapter nobody had classified was
  cleared by any isolated HOME — by an overlay materializing nothing for it (both found in
  review). `None` fails closed in BOTH directions, the same not-mapped-is-not-a-claim rule
  `contained_home_subpaths` uses. An `OVERLAY_MASKS` claim is checked against the masks it
  names *and* against whether they have anywhere to act, **per channel**: plugin masks with
  no `global_plugin_registry_subpaths` root are materialized nowhere. Aggregate sufficiency
  is not enough — antigravity declares both kinds of mask, so losing its registry root left
  its direct mask satisfying a "does it have masks" test while the plugin channel went
  uncovered. The two `CLI` declarations are no longer one kind of claim: claude's is
  **measured** at 2.1.231 (a paired run with and without `--strict-mcp-config` named seven
  servers against one), codex's is still a **reviewed assertion** and unmeasured — see §4's
  note on what provenance does and does not buy, which still applies to codex and to any
  claude build outside `_VERIFIED_VERSIONS`.
  **Latent until an adapter is both** — the mask-dependent adapters are exactly the ones
  that cannot inject, so `validate_mcp_support` refuses them first. It arms itself the day
  copilot or agy gains injection, which is why it went in before that rather than after.
- **Route plugin-registry masks into custom config-home mirrors.** Both mirror builders —
  `isolation.build_mcp_masked_home` and the runner's config-home mirror — forward only
  `reroot_config_masks(...)`, never `plugin_registry_subpaths` / `plugin_config_masks`. An
  adapter declaring both a plugin registry and a custom config home therefore gets a mirror
  where the plugin MCP channel is unmasked, and the child is repointed at that mirror. Needs
  a reroot for the registry subpaths (the `reroot_config_masks` prefix-strip, applied to
  paths rather than mask keys) plus the two call sites. Unreachable today — agy declares the
  plugin masks and no config home, the other three the reverse — and `Adapter.mcp_off_gap`
  REFUSES the combination meanwhile, with an arm that reads the leak out of the builder.
  Delete that refusal in the same commit that lands the routing; the arm will already be red.
- Sweep for other default-held invariants (`judge`, `max_cells`, `provision`).
- Report the `mcp_servers:` + no-overlay refusal in the **CLI pre-flight** as well, next to
  `validate_mcp_support` in `cmd_run` — today it surfaces as a failed cell per cell, where
  the sibling MCP refusals surface before anything runs ("they will always fail and waste
  tokens"). Deliberately not done with the refusal itself: nothing in the selftest drives
  `cmd_run` (only `validate_spec`), so the pre-flight copy would be a second wording of the
  rule with no arm to keep it honest. The blocker is the missing `cmd_run` harness, not the
  check — build that first, or this lands decorative.

Still open in `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §9 — **and this list is a pointer, not a copy: read §9.** It has
twice gone stale here while §9 was current, which is the same drift the counts in §4 are kept in one
place to avoid. As of 2026-08-12: codex's TOML arrays/inline tables via `-c` (probe #2); copilot's MCP
tool-name format **in its own events** and plugin-declared server reach (the two halves probe #3 did not
answer — its gating and config halves are resolved); agy's transcript tool-name format and `url` vs
`serverUrl` (probe #4); and C3-3, deliberately unpriced. **C3-4 came off this list on 2026-08-14** —
it was answered against NASA's public Earthdata endpoint rather than SlideRule's, which settles the
session-lifecycle question the bridge's ending model needed and leaves SlideRule's own behaviour, and
§8's credential half, still unmeasured; `tools/probe_session_mcp.py --url --header-env` re-runs it there (the token named by an env var, never argv).
claude's `mcpServers` http/sse shape was resolved by #106 and sat here as open for two merges after that.
