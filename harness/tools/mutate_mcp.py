"""Mutation-test the declared-MCP and credential-containment arms.

Each mutation reintroduces a plausible version of the defect the arm exists to catch; the
named arm MUST go red. An arm that stays green while its defect is present is decorative.

Run it: `python3 harness/tools/mutate_mcp.py` (needs `harness/.venv`). It copies the tree to
a tempdir, checks the baseline passes, then applies one mutation at a time and re-runs the
suite that owns the mutated file. Exit 0 only when every mutation is caught BY ITS NAMED ARM
— "some arm failed" is not the same claim.

THREE SUITES, chosen by the file the mutation perturbs rather than declared per entry.
`agentskill_evals/` is proven by the selftest; `fixtures/` and `tools/` by
`tools/verify_mcp_fixtures.py`; and the proxy's I/O half plus the awkward server it is driven
against by `tools/verify_mcp_proxy.py`, those two named explicitly because each sits in a
directory another suite owns. Deriving the suite from the target rather than adding a sixth
field is the same argument `_classify` already makes about the id prefix: a fact that can be
stated independently will eventually be stated wrongly, and here the wrong suite means a
mutation reported as uncaught because the program that would have caught it never ran.

Three failure modes it reports, all of which have happened and none of which mean the code
is fine:

  STALE ANCHOR         the find-text no longer exists; the mutation tested nothing. Re-anchor
                       it against the current source. Expect this whenever you refactor.
  failed, but NOT via  the selftest went red for another reason — very often the mutated
                       source no longer parses (an anchor whose indentation was a substring
                       of a differently-indented line, a condition split across lines without
                       parentheses). Check the mutant compiles before believing the result.
  *** MISSED ***       the defect is present and every arm still passes. Either the arm is
                       decorative, or a SECOND defence added later masks this one — see M53,
                       where deregistration and note-deduplication each hide the other, so
                       the mutation has to remove both (`find`/`repl` accept tuples for this).

Adding a mutation: keep it to the smallest edit that reintroduces the real defect, and point
it at the one arm that should notice. If you cannot name that arm, the arm does not exist yet
and writing it is the actual work.

THREE ID PREFIXES, and they are counted and reported separately.

  M<n>   a PRODUCTION mutation — the normal case, and what "N/N caught" is a claim about.
         It perturbs the code under test and asks whether the instrument notices.
  F<n>   a FIXTURE-or-TOOL mutation, proven by `verify_mcp_fixtures.py`. These perturb an
         instrument and ask whether that instrument's own verifier notices — the same
         epistemics as `I*` rather than `M*`, so they are counted apart from production for
         the same reason. What makes them worth having, where mutating the selftest is not,
         is that the verifier is a SEPARATE program from what it checks: `verify_mcp_fixtures`
         does not import the shim, it drives it over pipes. Nothing here is circular, and the
         gap they close is real — until now the fixtures and probes carried no mutation
         coverage at all, so every assertion in that verifier was named but unproven.
  I<n>   an INSTRUMENT mutation — it perturbs `selftest.py` itself. Almost always the wrong
         thing to write, because mutating the test to prove the test fails is circular and
         establishes nothing about the code. It is legitimate only where the selftest has a
         FEATURE of its own whose failure mode no production edit can reach. Both current
         entries are the ARM COUNTER, which is such a feature: I1 stops it counting and I2
         reverts it to a process-lifetime total, and each failure leaves every arm passing
         and the banner reporting a plausible wrong number.
         If a new `I*` seems necessary, that is the moment to check you are not just testing
         the test — the separate heading in the summary exists so this decision is made in
         the open rather than by quietly appending to the list.

The prefix is NOT taken on trust: `_classify` derives the class from the target file and
refuses to start unless the id agrees. A convention relating two independent facts holds only
until someone types the wrong letter, and every direction miscounts exactly what the split
reporting exists to keep straight. It also refuses a mutation aimed at this file: mutating the
mutation runner to see whether the mutation runner notices is the circularity the `I*` heading
exists to keep rare, with none of the justification.

Every result line carries TWO clocks, and the difference between them is the point. Wall time
is what `_SUITE_TIMEOUT` bounds; CPU time is what the mutation actually spent. Read both
against the `baseline:` lines: a mutation taking several times its suite's baseline IN CPU is
the M65 shape — a defect that has turned some walk recursive and is burning a core — and it is
the only notice anyone gets before it grows past the timeout and reports as a hang. Wall time
alone stopped being able to say that the moment `--jobs` existed, because eight suites sharing
a machine all take longer without any of them being wrong.

`--jobs N` runs N mutations at once, each in its OWN copy of the tree, defaulting to 1. It is
worth having because this suite is mostly WAITING: the proxy arms spend their time on settles
and grace periods rather than on a core, which is why a serial run leaves the machine ~90%
idle. What parallelism must not do is change a verdict, so everything that decides one stays
where it was — the anchor and arm guards run serially up front, each worker mutates only its
own tree, and results are printed in list order however they finish. The one thing that DID
have to change is in the proxy verifier: its survivor check was scoped by pid identity, which
excludes a leak from a previous mutation but not a live guardian from a concurrent worker, so
`mcp_proxy_io.is_guardian_command` now scopes by tree as well.

    (PR #103). One step of a cleanup failing is not permission to skip the next.

    NOTHING IS RAISED OUT OF HERE, for the same reason: this runs while something else may
    already be unwinding, and an exception from a cleanup path replaces the failure that caused
    it. `_signal` already treats a process that is gone or was never ours as done, so what
    reaches these handlers is a pid it REFUSED — a broadcast target, see its docstring — or an
    errno nobody expected. Both are facts the caller reports rather than trips over.

def owned_pids(table, root=None, marker=None):
    """Everything one suite run owns: the `root`'s descendants, plus anything naming `marker`.

    NEITHER SELECTOR HAS A MAGIC NUMBER. "No root" is `None`, exactly as "no marker" is — a
    value that cannot be a pid, cannot be an `in` operand, and cannot be handed to `os.kill`.
    An earlier version used `-1` for it, on the reasoning that no process has that parent. That
    is true and it is not the point: the value did not stay inside the lookup it was invented
    for, and `kill(-1)` is the most destructive call on the system.

    TWO INDEPENDENT REASONS FOR MEMBERSHIP, because each is blind exactly where the other sees.

    The PPID CHAIN is the complete answer while the chain exists, and it is the only one that
    reaches a process whose argv says nothing about us. It reaches through a `setsid` — a new
    session changes the group, never the parent — which is what makes it, and not a process
    group, the right instrument here: the proxy's guardian is spawned `start_new_session=True`
    on purpose, and the escaping helper in §10.9 calls `setsid` on purpose, so a `killpg` aimed
    at the suite misses precisely the two processes this exists to catch.

    The MARKER IS SUPPLEMENTARY EVIDENCE, and nothing rests on it. It recovers SOME of what
    the chain no longer reaches — the instant the root is signalled its descendants are
    reparented and every link above them is gone — and where it does, the work tree's path is a
    fresh `mkdtemp` no other process on the machine can be carrying, so a match is conclusive.

    A MISS IS NOT, AND THE EARLIER CONTRACT CLAIMED OTHERWISE. It said every process a suite
    starts carries that path. Measured over one run of each suite, 5 of 7 selftest descendants,
    35 of 49 fixture descendants and 67 of 169 proxy descendants did not: `node`, `git`, and
    above all processes caught BETWEEN FORK AND EXEC, which `ps` shows as a bare `(python3.10)`
    with no argv at all — the state a just-forked child is in, which is exactly the child a
    race produces. Containment therefore rests on `kill_owned` freezing the tree while
    parentage still connects it, and this arm only adds to what that already reached.

    "NO MARKER" IS `None`, AND THE EMPTY STRING IS REFUSED. `"" in command` is true of every
    process alive, so a marker arm switched off by falsiness puts one boolean between this
    function and SIGKILLing the machine — and this file's whole purpose is to run versions of
    itself with a line removed. `None` is not a boolean weaker than that; it is a value `in`
    cannot accept, so the mutation that deletes the guard raises `TypeError` and kills nothing,
    where the mutation that deletes a `if marker:` would have swept the host. The empty string
    is then refused outright rather than treated as `None`, because a caller that computed one
    by accident meant a path and got nothing.

    CAUGHT instead of MISSED (review, PR #111).

    RE-ENUMERATING IS THE DEFECT. After the kill the survivors are orphans: parentage no longer

    a third of real descendants carry no work-tree path, and one caught between fork and exec
    carries no argv at all. So asking the machine again answers "clean" about exactly the
    processes that got away, which is the one answer this must not be able to give.

    FREEZE FIRST, KILL SECOND, and the order is the whole mechanism. An earlier version
    enumerated and killed in one pass, trusting the marker to recover anything spawned in
    between — on the claim that every process a suite starts carries its work tree's path in
    its argv. THAT CLAIM IS FALSE, and measurably so: over one run of each suite, 5 of 7
    selftest descendants, 35 of 49 fixture descendants and 67 of 169 proxy descendants had no
    such path — `node`, `git`, and above all processes caught BETWEEN FORK AND EXEC, which
    `ps` shows as a bare `(python3.10)` with no argv at all (review, PR #111).

    That last case is what makes the marker not merely incomplete but backwards: the processes
    it cannot name are exactly the just-forked ones, which are exactly the ones the race is
    about. So this no longer races. `SIGSTOP` is unblockable and a stopped process cannot
    fork, so each round freezes what parentage can still reach and the next round catches only
    what those had already forked before they stopped. The set therefore shrinks to nothing,
    and once it does, NOTHING IN THE TREE CAN CREATE ANYTHING — the kill that follows is
    against a fixed population rather than a moving one.

    WHAT IS REPORTED IS THE SET THIS FUNCTION FROZE, not a re-enumeration. After the kill the
    survivors are orphans, unreachable by parentage and possibly unnamed by the marker, so
    asking the machine again would answer "clean" about exactly the processes that got away.

    A TREE THAT WILL NOT QUIESCE IS A NAMED FAILURE, not a silent one. Everything frozen is
    killed on every path, including that one and including an exception, because a process left
    stopped is worse than one left running: it never exits, and the `wait4` above would block
    on it forever. That sentence rests entirely on WHEN `frozen` is written and on `_kill_all`
    finishing its loop — a registry updated after the act names nothing the act already touched,
    and a cleanup that stops at its first failure abandons the rest of what it was registered
    for. Both were true here, and the second is why the kills go through `_kill_all`.

    ON THE TIMEOUT PATH ONLY, and never after a run that finished. A sweep after a clean run
    would be tidying away exactly the survivors the proxy verifier exists to notice, and a green
    suite would then certify a leak this function had quietly cleaned up on its behalf.

    A CONTAMINATED TREE IS NEVER HANDED BACK, which is the hole that sentence used to have.
    `Outcome.leftover` already said "the next mutation to draw this tree inherits it" — and the

    AN EXCEPTION COUNTS AS CONTAMINATION, because `clean` is only ever set by getting to the end
    of a run that said it was clean. A sweep that raised is precisely the case where what is
    still running is unknown, so the default has to be the careful one.

    THE PILL IS WHAT THE POOL GETS INSTEAD. A thread that passed the check above and is already

    DELETING A TREE WITH A LIVE PROCESS IN IT IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE SAME LEAK. The sweep
    already says when it left a descendant alive or could not look; `rmtree` then removes the
    directory that process is executing out of, which destroys the only evidence of what it was
    and where it came from while doing nothing whatever about the process (review, PR #111).

    SO A POISONED RUN KEEPS ITS TREES AND SAYS WHERE THEY ARE. §4's verification block globs for
    exactly this prefix afterwards and will report them, which is the correct outcome rather
    than a nuisance: the tree is the evidence, and the glob is the only thing that would
    otherwise notice.

    AND THE ANSWER IS OBSERVED, NEVER ASSUMED. `ignore_errors=True` next to `return True` is a
    function suppressing its own failures and then reporting success — a clean run could leave
    every tree on disk and still exit 0 (review, PR #111). The flag stays, because a teardown
    that raises partway through is worse than one that does what it can; what changes is that
    the claim afterwards comes from looking. It is the same rule `probe_group_empty` follows in
    `mcp_proxy_io.py`: an errno from a call you made is a fact about the call, and the question
    was about the world.

    ONE FACT, TWO REASONS. `False` means the trees are still there, and the message above says
    which of "kept on purpose" and "would not go" it was. Every caller wants the fact.
