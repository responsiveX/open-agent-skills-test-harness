"""LLM-as-judge.

The judge is itself one of the agent adapters (default: claude) run in a
throwaway workspace. It is handed a compact transcript of the graded run — the
user prompt, the agent's final answer, the commands/tools it ran, and the
resulting file tree — and scores each rubric behavior pass/fail with a reason.

All judge runs are tool-free (``disable_tools=True``): the judge prompt
contains everything needed for grading (transcript, tool trace, file
contents). Tools would let the judge explore its own empty temp workspace
and draw wrong conclusions about file existence.

Adapters that support native structured output (``supports_output_schema``,
e.g. Claude Code's ``--json-schema``) additionally get a schema constraint.
Other adapters (Copilot, Codex, AntiGravity) get explicit JSON format
instructions in the prompt and the verdict is parsed from the final answer.

Because the judge rides on the same adapter machinery, you can grade with any
agent (``--judge-agent codex``), not just Claude.
