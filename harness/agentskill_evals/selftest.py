            # WHY REVERSE IT: `socket()`+`bind()` is a capability a restricted environment
            # may deny outright, and this arm was the selftest's only such dependency — one
            # red arm out of 579 under a sandbox, for a fixture whose only requirement is
            # "a directory entry that is not a link, a directory, or a regular file".

            # sun_path budget that made the old fixture bind RELATIVE from inside the
            # workspace stops applying too, so the chdir dance goes with it.
            #

    An isolated home is a symlink OVERLAY, not a copy: `isolation._overlay` wholesale-
    symlinks every entry it is not told to mask, so two isolated cells' `.codex/config.toml`
    are two paths to one real file. The first version of this guard gated on isolation,
    believing a private home made concurrency safe; review disproved it, and the arm below
    now proves the sharing directly rather than assuming either way.

    So the property that matters is per-cell MATERIALIZED config. `parallel_safe_config`
    declares it per adapter and no adapter claims it; a CONTAINED HOME establishes it per
    RUN, because `build_isolated_home` with `contained_subpaths` copies instead of
    wholesale-symlinking and leaves no path resolving out of the cell's own tree. So the
    guard permits `--jobs>1` exactly when every cell will be contained — isolation on, an
    adapter that supports containment, and a credential in the environment — and refuses it
    otherwise. Each of those three is asserted below from the failing direction, because
    dropping any one of them silently returns the run to sharing one real config.

    It was an unenforced invariant before any of this: DEFAULT_JOBS is 1, so the harness was
    safe by accident, and `jobs` is a scenario-override key, so YAML could raise it without
    anyone passing a flag.

    # independent time, and a stateful/time-varying command can hand the two
    # processes DIFFERENT listings, so a populated gate FAILS CLOSED for the whole
    # invocation instead (copilot.odr_gate_on_fails_closed below). What stays
    # testable off-Windows is the gate DETECTION (the registry read + ECMAScript
    # trim/falsy test) and the fail-closed decisions, exercised via stubs.
    # `copilot_mod` and `sys` are already in scope from earlier in run_selftest.
    # The Windows fully-qualified predicate copilot home resolution leans on. Runs on every
    # host because _win_fully_qualified uses ntpath explicitly — so the UNC-root, device-
    # namespace, volume-GUID, and canonicality logic (the heart of the path findings) is
    # verified off-win32 too. splitdrive returns a bare \\?\C: (and \\?\C:.copilot) as a
    # complete "drive" with an empty tail on every supported Python, so these fixtures are
    # version-stable (asserted on 3.10–3.14). Windows skips path normalization ONLY after
    # an EXACT literal \\?\ prefix, so under \\?\ only an already-canonical literal prefix
    # qualifies (a rooted drive, a volume-GUID root, or the extended-UNC share root — each
    # with an optional single trailing separator); a noncanonical literal \\?\ (a '/' or a
    # '.'/'..'/internal-or-repeated-empty segment) and ANY nonliteral //?/ spelling fail
    # closed, because copilot's Node resolver canonicalizes/folds-to-literal (its open then
    # skips normalization) while the harness's spelling is Win32-normalized, diverging. A
    # \\.\ path is exempt — Windows normalizes it in both processes, so it reconverges —
    # except a BARE \\.\ (or \\?\) root or an INCOMPLETE extended-UNC root, which
    # 3.10/3.11 (bare) and 3.11 (trailing-sep UNC) join with a DOUBLED separator vs
    # Node's single one (PROVEN divergence there; on 3.12+ the joins coincide and the
    # rejection is CONSERVATIVE — one uniform version-stable rule): fail closed.
    # Ordinary UNC roots must be COMPLETE (server AND share): Node joins a bare \\ into
    # \mcp-config.json, resolved from the child drive's root — a real file copilot
    # loads — while the harness's join names nothing. A TERMINAL-COLON body end is
    # rejected everywhere, two cases under one test: a WHOLE-DRIVE colon root
    # (\\?\foo:, \\srv\share:) is a PROVEN glue — splitdrive returns it whole as a
    # drive ending in ":", so ntpath.join GLUES the child name on where Node inserts
    # the separator, and no normalization reconverges a colon glue — while a colon-
    # terminal DEVICE body past a rooted drive (\\?\C:\dir:) joins exactly like Node
    # on every version and is rejected CONSERVATIVELY (stream syntax, never a
    # directory). The ordinary-UNC arm only rejects the whole-drive form: a UNC tail
    # merely ending in ":" (\\srv\share\dir:) joins like Node and passes.

    call the pure functions directly; the wire-level driver covers sequencing.

    Each arm pins a rule §10.9 names as one a plausible implementation gets wrong, and every
    one of them is a way the proxy could DEGRADE — forward something it did not understand —
    rather than fail the cell, which is the single property §10.5 exists to guarantee.

    THE LOAD-BEARING ARMS GO THROUGH `decide()`, and that is a correction rather than a
    style. An arm that calls `refusal_for()` proves a message is well worded and proves
    nothing about whether an off-list call is ever refused; the first cut of this section did
    exactly that, and would have passed against a proxy that forwarded every call (review, PR

    # never in the printing — it was in nothing being wired to listen.
