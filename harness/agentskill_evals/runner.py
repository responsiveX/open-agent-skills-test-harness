"""The runner: execute a matrix of (target × eval) for a single agent, assert, and report.
A target is a model id plus an optional pinned reasoning effort (see spec.ModelTarget), so
one run can compare e.g. claude-haiku-4.5@high against claude-opus-4.6@low.

For each cell it:
  1. builds a hermetic workspace (optionally from a fixture),
  2. provisions the eval's skill(s) into the agent's skills dir,
  3. seeds any declared `files`,
  4. renders the prompt (filling {skill}/{skills} per adapter),
  5. runs the agent via exec.execute(),
  6. writes raw + normalized artifacts,
  7. runs every effective assertion (deterministic + rubric/judge),
  8. records a CellResult.

Results stream to artifacts/<run_id>/ and a summary table is returned for the CLI.

    """Why `--jobs > 1` cannot be honored for this run, or None if it can.

    The original guard refused NON-isolated parallel runs only, on the premise that an
    isolated cell's private home made concurrency safe. That premise was wrong, and review
    caught it: an isolated home is a symlink OVERLAY, not a copy. `isolation._overlay`
    wholesale-symlinks every entry it is not explicitly told to mask, so two isolated
    cells' `.codex/config.toml` are two paths to one real file — verified by writing
    through one overlay and reading the change back through another, with the write also
    landing in the user's real home. Only `isolation_config_masks` entries are
    materialized, and no adapter masks its whole config home.

    The fix for that was to refuse `--jobs > 1` outright unless the adapter declares
    `parallel_safe_config`, which no adapter does. That is correct but broader than the
    hazard: what actually matters is whether the adapter's mutable configuration is
    materialized PER CELL, and CONTAINED mode does exactly that. `build_isolated_home`
    with `contained_subpaths` runs the copy pass instead of the wholesale symlink pass and
    creates no symlink resolving out of the tree, so each cell's HOME is a private
    directory and every file the CLI writes into it — config, startup bookkeeping,
    whatever — is that cell's own. There is no shared path left for cell A to corrupt for
    cell B, which is the same property `parallel_safe_config` names, arrived at per run
    rather than declared per adapter.

    So this reproduces `_run_cell_body`'s own containment decision
    (`contain_home = has_credentials and contained_subs is not None`, taking effect only
    under isolation) and requires it to hold for EVERY cell. Conservative in two
    directions on purpose:

      * Only the credential-env-var half of `has_credentials` is accepted. A spec whose
        credentials arrive by MCP `${VAR}` interpolation would also be contained, but that
        is resolved mid-cell from state this cannot see, so it is treated as unsafe.
      * The check reads the same merged `os.environ` + `spec.env` each cell will read, so
        a spec that blanks the variable is caught rather than assumed.

    Refused rather than warned, as before: the failure mode is a wrong ANSWER, not a
    crash — cell A's agent writes config cell B reads mid-launch, and the nondeterminism
    gets attributed to the model.

        A matrix's whole purpose is comparison — "model A scored better than model B" is
        the claim the artifact makes. That claim silently requires the cells to differ
        ONLY in the thing being compared. Three things can drift underneath it without
        failing a single cell:

        * **CLI version.** The failure that started this line of work: copilot rewrote its
          own executable from 1.0.64 to 1.0.72 in four days. A long matrix, or two runs a
          day apart, can straddle an auto-update, and every cell still passes. The
          difference then gets attributed to the model.
        * **MCP server set.** Cells that disabled different servers ran against different
          configurations.
        * **Isolation.** A cell that fell back to non-isolated saw skills its siblings did
          not (``CellResult.isolated`` already records the ACHIEVED state, which is why
          this reads that rather than the requested flag).

        Reported, never enforced, and deliberately so: by the time this runs the cells have
        executed and been paid for, so failing them would destroy results that are still
        perfectly readable once the reader knows they are not comparable. What is prevented
        is the silent part.

        Unknown is not agreement, on EVERY axis. A ``cli_version`` of None means the runner
        does not state it (codex, antigravity); an ``mcp_servers_seen`` of None means the
        runner does not express its servers where this can read them (antigravity's file
        masks). A matrix of all-unknown is not "consistent" — it is unverifiable, which is
        reported as its own state so a green consistency line never implies a check that
        could not run. ``verified`` therefore requires every axis to be positively known
        AND uniform: an adapter that can prove it ran no MCP servers says so with ``[]``,
        and one that cannot say anything gets ``unverified``, not a green line resting on
        one axis while another was never read.
